            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genadius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he was very well skill'd in Divine and Humane Sciences; That he wrote ſeveral Treatiſes in a clean, polite, and Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Stile, which</hi> Genadius <hi>had read, when he wrote thus of him, which was in the Year</hi> 495.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Du Pin</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is not neceſſary to commend the Beauty and Elegancy of</hi> Salvian's <hi>Stile; 'tis ſufficiently known to all that have but a little ſmattering in Learning. It would be hard to find in all Antiquity, a more Neat, Beautiful, Smooth, and Pleaſant Diſcourſe; He is not ſo diffuſive as</hi> Lactantius, <hi>but is more Diverting, and full of Inſtructions; He proves what he aſſerts by</hi> Texts of Scripture, <hi>which he alledges much to his Purpoſe, and which come up very well to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand. His way of handling of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of God's Government of the World, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that his main End was, to Cry down, and declaim againſt the Manners and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Age, which he does with all poſſible Strength and Elegancy; deſcribing the common Irregularities, and the Terrible Corrupt Manners of the People, and the Aſtoniſhing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs of the</hi> Theatres and Play-Houſes.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere are two Things that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Tranſlation of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the World, and juſtifie the Uſefulneſs of a Man's Pains in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him more publick, and capable of being read and underſtood by many more, than poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could be in his own Native Language. And thoſe are, the Seaſonableneſs of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he treats of, and the Excellent and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner of handling that Doctrine; And both theſe we have in this Admirable Author, who is now made to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Uſe and Advantage of the Natives of our own Country. And therefore, that the Reader may reap that Benefit by it, which was deſign'd him, and peruſe the following Tranſlation with that Care, Temper, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mind, as Subjects of that weight ought to be, I ſhall, by way of Introduction,
<pb facs="tcp:100854:4"/>
endeavour to raiſe his Thoughts and Faculties, that they may bear ſome meaſure of Proportion to the Greatneſs of the Subject. Here he muſt not expect (what is the preſent Shame and Burden of the Preſs) to meet with any light and frothy Diſcourſes, or empty, vain, and uſeleſs Speculations; but a Fundamental Pilar of Religion, ſupported by grave, ſolid, and irrefragable Arguments; And if the Reader hath nothing to pleaſe, but a wild Fancy and roving Appetite, if nothing can gratifie him but lewd Jeſts, and unſavoury Ribaldry, he will be here mightily out of his Way; but if he knows how to reliſh clear and Convincing Reaſons; if he can be affected with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truths of Religion: In ſhort, if he bring his Judgment and Conſcience along with him, the Tranſlator will never loſe his Pains, nor the Reader his Profit. For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Subject Matter of the following Book is always Seaſonable, fit for all Times, and all Perſons.</hi> That God governs the World, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintends all the Affairs of it; That they are not order'd and manag'd by blind Chance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nececeſſity, or the Will of Man, but by an All-wiſe and Omnipotent Governour, who ſits at the Helm, guides and directs the whole Univerſe, and all the Parts and Branches of it; In a word, that God is Judge himſelf, Judge here, as well as hereafter, and exerciſeth a Soveraign and Judicial Power in the whole Adminiſtration of this World. This, I ſay, is a Doctrine not calculated for Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for an Age, or peculiar People, but is
<pb facs="tcp:100854:4"/>
adapted to the whole World, neceſſary for all Times, Perſons, Nations and Languages. 'Tis the Foundation of all Men's Prayers. The firſt Reaſon of all that Worſhip and Homage, which hath every where been paid to the moſt High God, for no Man would, no Man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably could pray to that Being, who, he thought, did not hear, or neglect, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf with what was done upon Earth. And our Praiſes and Celebrations would be as vain as our Petitions, if the God, whom we celebrated, did not in particular regard the Actions and Behaviour of Men. But if God hears and minds our Prayers and Praiſes; for the ſame Reaſon he hears and minds our Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Blaſphemies too. If he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judges of the Sincerity of our Hearts, upon the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he judges alſo of their Hypocriſie; and our Iniquities are as open before God, as our Devotions. And the Conſequence is, That the whole World lies under the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and Judgment of God. And this is the firſt Step in the Doctrine of Providence, that God inſpects and judges the whole World in General, and every individual Man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But the Subject Matter of our Prayers extends yet further, which for the moſt part, concerns the Things of this Life; as petition<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing for Secular Bleſſings, deprecating Miſchiefs and Inconveniences, which plainly ſuppoſe the Belief of God's Government of the World, and that the Things we reſpectively ask of Him are purely at His diſpoſal. To petition God for our Daily Bread, plainly implies, that he
<pb facs="tcp:100854:5"/>
as daily gives it; and to beg to be reſcu'd from Temptations, deliver'd from Evils, as plainly denotes, that the Things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that may tempt, or injure us, are in God's hands, and may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or reſtrain'd, as He ſees Good. And the Concluſion from theſe Premiſes is this, That this Doctrine is ſeaſonable and neceſſary for all Men that pray, that is always, at all times, and upon all Occaſions: For hereby we are taught, that all Second Cauſes are Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in God's hands to fulfil his Will, and in all manner of Diſpenſations to look beyond them, and to fix our Thoughts and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Supreme Arbiter and Governour of the World. To be Thankful in Proſperity, Patient and Humble in Adverſity: To take what we enjoy for Mercies, what we ſuffer for Chaſtiſements and Corrections, diſpenſed to Us from our Heavenly Father. Upon this Foundation we are warranted to beg of God, Protection from Injuries, Deliverance from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Supply for our Neceſſities, Succeſs in our honeſt Undertakings; And upon this Ground we can truſt in, and rely upon God, tho' all the World forſake us, and freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom our ſelves to Him, when Men will not hear us: So that this Doctrine is the Stay and Support of the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> World, and affords De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the Happy, Comfort to the Miſerable, Refuge and Shelter to the Oppreſſed, Security to the Traveller, Safeguard to them that reſt, Contentment under Diſappointments, Increaſe to the Merchant and Induſtrious, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to All. Fetters and Priſons, Thrones and
<pb facs="tcp:100854:5"/>
Dominions, all Degrees and Qualities, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually and alike concern'd in it. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our Condition be in this World; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Poſture the Things are in that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or within us; whatever are the States of Publick Societies, or private Men; whether we have or want any thing, whether we hope or fear, whether we rejoyce or are ſorrowful; in all theſe Reſpects, and in every other Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Life, we are directly and immediately concern'd with the Divine Providence, and may find from thence Matter for Supplication, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for Dependance, and Reaſons for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration and Worſhip. That Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be ſeaſonable, which is equally ſuited to all Caſes and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Circumſtances; To all Ranks and Degrees; to all States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to all Caſualties and Contingencies of Life; And all the different Seaſons, which<note place="margin">

               <hi>Solomon</hi> Aſſigns to the different Uſes and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Life, in this Reſpect have no manner of Difference; <hi>There is a ſeaſon to plant, and a ſeaſon to pluck up</hi> (Literally and Alluſively) but both are Seaſons for directing our Thoughts for Contemplation of the Divine Providence. <hi>There is a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time to get, and a time to loſe, a time of War, and a time of Peace.</hi> But theſe and all other, are Times for meditating on, and applying this Doctrine, either to beg God's Bleſſing and Protection, or to render Him Thanks and Praiſe for having beſtow'd it; Or to humble our ſelves under His Almighty Hand, or to give Him the Glory of His power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:100854:6"/>
for preſerving our Perſons, Eſtates, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. In fine, how various ſoever the Affairs of the World are, how unſtable the Poſſeſſions, how Surprizing and Aſtoniſhing the Events! This Doctrine is ready at hand, to pacifie our Minds, and to preſent us with infinite and unſpeakable Advantages, if it be not our own Fault; and we deprive our ſelves of them thro' Atheiſm, Incredulity, a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God and our ſelves. Nevertheleſs, tho' this Doctrine be very proper, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all Times and Perſons, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, That it may at ſome times be yet more Seaſonable, and more fit to be inculcated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, and aſſerted; and thoſe, ſeem to me, to be theſe that follow,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When this Great Doctrine of Providence is corrupted and perverted, and by unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inferences and Deductions, is made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to Ends and Purpoſes; I mean, to other Ends and Purpoſes, than thoſe of Religion and Virtue.</hi> For inſtance, when we are told, that Succeſs and Events create a Divine Right to Property and Dominion, that Poſſeſſion and Providence, is a Title ſuperior to all legal Claims and Pretences; That this is the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Men's Providences, is too Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to be deny'd, and therefore need not be proved; and it would take up too much of the Reader's time, and with all be unſuitable to the Nature and End of this Preface, to have it debated. All that I ſhall at preſent remark, is, That 'tis perfectly new, and as far as I know, this Doctrine was ſtarted within ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:100854:6"/>
our Memories, and lay for ſome time ſcorn'd and exploded, till reviv'd of late; All Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and all Ages of the Church are perfect Strangers to it, except our own. The Fathers of old, and Holy Men in all Ages, have been copious on the Subject; but the Myſtery of providential Rights and Titles is a Myſtery of Iniquity, reſerved for our Times, and fit to be diſcover'd, when the ſame Doctrines can both be deſpiſed and laugh'd at, and alſo own'd and aſſerted by the ſame Perſons. However in ſuch a Caſe, it ſeems highly requiſite, that Men be ſet ſtraight in their Notion, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be plac'd in its true light; for as this, or any other Doctrine of Religion, if it be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, or miſapply'd, draws after it an innumerable Company of practical Miſchiefs and Inconveniences: So if it be rightly ſtated, and duely obſerv'd, it produceth in abundance the fruits of Holineſs and true Piety. And for this I ſhall refer the Reader to the Book it ſelf, where he will find this uſeful Doctrine plainly aſſerted, and convincingly prov'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being endanger'd, or tempted to ſet up God's Providence in contradiction to His Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When this Doctrine is deny'd either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms, or by neceſſary Conſequence;</hi> This I take to be the moſt irrational and ſenſeleſs O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the whole World, and even more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than Atheiſm it ſelf; for the Denial of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence proceeds upon the Suppoſition of the Being of a God, and to believe a God, and at the ſame time to deny his Providence, carries
<pb facs="tcp:100854:7"/>
with it a thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contradictions; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, what Idea or Conception ſuch Men can have of God, what kind of Being they can frame to themſelves, or what Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation they can make of Him excluſive of the Divine Providence; Let them give us His Attributes and Characters, and tell us plainly, what they mean by God, and then they muſt either renounce their Opinion, or frame ſuch a God to themſelves, as all Men will be aſham'd of; For certainly, the Notion of God implies all poſſible Perfection, and a ſluggiſh, unactive, impotent, inconſiderate, negligent God, is an imperfect God, and they aſcribe greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections to the Moſt High God, than can honeſtly be attributed to a wiſe and good Man But if the Notion of God implies the moſt perfect Being, ſuch a Being, who is infinitely Wiſe, Powerful, Juſt and Good. Theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes plainly prove the Divine Providence: For if God be infinitely Wiſe, he certainly knows all that is done in the World, the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Deſigns, the cloſeſt Contrivances. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Powerful, certainly, he is able to defeat them, to over-rule them, and to turn them to ſuch Ends as he pleaſes; If infinitely Juſt and Good, he certainly will do it, when it is fit for him ſo to do: So that the very Notion of God implies Providence, and proves it <hi>a prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> God's Providence is the Reſult of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and flows from it: And it is impoſſible to have any Conception of God, but at the ſame time to include Providence, and God's Soveraign Power in the World: However,
<pb facs="tcp:100854:7"/>
ſeeing we are got into an Age, where every thing is diſputed; ſeeing our <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> World is peſter'd with a Sort of Men, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to call themſelves Maſters of Senſe and Reaſon, tho' of far more Arrogance than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, it ſeems reaſonable and juſt to our Countrymen, that the Antidote ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Poyſon; and here I muſt again refer the Reader to the Book: And if he comes prepar'd to receive either Truth or Reaſon, let him read it with Judgment and Diſcretion, and then let him be an Epicurean, or Anti-provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentialiſt, if he can.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When there is a general Corruption in Men's Manners.</hi> This (in Scripture Language) is call'd living without God in the World; and it certainly is ſo, ſo far as Mortals can live without God, when God is neglected, His Laws violated, and Men live as if they had no other Concern with the Governour of the World, but to deſpiſe and affront Him. When Uncleanneſs, Inceſt, Sodomy, Perjury, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Oppreſſion, Unnaturalneſs reign, I would ſay <hi>in every Corner;</hi> but that ſuppoſes ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Shame and Modeſty; ſome Awe of Men at leaſt, if none of God; but when Vice grows bold and rampant, is above Reproof, and ſcorns it; when it hath it's Advocates and Pleaders, is turn'd into Principles and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; This is the higheſt Aggravation of the higheſt Crimes. 'Tis ſuperfluous to ſpeak of Pride, Luxury, Fraud, Extortion, Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Uncharitableneſs, which may paſs for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in compariſon of ſome Impieties. And
<pb facs="tcp:100854:8"/>
to what purpoſe ſhould I mention Hereſie and Schiſm, for theſe ſuppoſe ſome Religion, which in ſome Ages of the World is not eaſie to be found. Now how far, and in what inſtances theſe Characters ſuit with the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, is not for me to determine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without coming to Particulars, certain I am, that in a looſe and Vicious Age, all the Reſtraints of Religion are not too much to ſtop that Deluge of Impiety which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming the World, and wou'd to God they were all ſufficient. This ſingle Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, hath a mighty Efficacy to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and if it were planted in our Hearts, and riveted by frequent and ſerious Meditation; This alone would be ſufficient to curb the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and Licenciouſneſs of Sin, to humble the proudeſt Sinner, and bring him to utter Shame and Confuſion of Face. For let Men be minded, let them believe it, let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think of it; That God ſees, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with their Thoughts and Contrivances, as well as with their actual Commiſſion of Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; That he will judge 'em for them, here, and hereafter; That ſo many ſteps of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany are ſo many degrees nearer to Vengeance, That thereby we are preparing our ſelves for the Plagues of this, and the other World. And if after this, we can ſtill obſtinately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Iniquity; if we can defie God to his very face, and act all manner of Outrages and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in His Preſence, our Iniquities ripen apace, and the meaſure of them ſeems very near filling up; and how much ſoever we may
<pb facs="tcp:100854:8"/>
deſpiſe or neglect this Doctrine, we are in the ready way to feel it to our Coſt, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible Objects of it, and Examples to others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When Men pretend to believe the Divine Providence, and at the ſame time live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetual Contradiction to ſuch Belief:</hi> All Sin indeed does ſo; but that which I chiefly aim at, is, when Men ſhall take ungodly and unwarrantable Methods to ſave themſelves, or to accompliſh their Ends. This is a Practice apparently inconſiſtent with the Belief of God's Providence. If any man ſteps out of God's way to preſerve himſelf; or to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Deſigns, whatever he pretends, he does not in truth believe God's Providence, nor dare he truſt Him; if in a viſible proſpect of Danger, or Inconvenience to our Perſons or Intereſts, we ſhall baſely abandon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and break in upon the Laws of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for to get a little Security, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a threatning Storm; If we can take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Courſes to be Rich, Great, Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or Safe; if we can trifle with Religion for Temporal Ends, and make Hypocriſie a Guard and Sanctuary: In fine, if we can do Evil, to prevent ſuffering it, and make bold with God to keep our ſelves eaſie, quiet, or flouriſhing in this World, inſtead of believing, we diſtruſt God's Providence, and forfeit His Protection; we abandon our beſt Security, and take our Cauſe into our own hands; we forſake providence, and are reſolved to ſhift for our ſelves. Now in ſuch Caſes as theſe,
<pb facs="tcp:100854:9"/>
(and God only knows how many ſuch Caſes, there are among Us) the only way to recall Us to a ſteddy and uniform Dependance upon God, and to make us act regularly in Conformity to it, is to gain a firm and ſtedfaſt Belief of this Great Doctrine. I ſay, a firm and ſtedfaſt Belief of it in our Hearts; For while 'tis only a Notion in our Heads, 'tis like a Problem, or School Queſtion, and ſerves for Talk and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but not to live by; But 'tis then only Serviceable to the Ends of Religion, when it becomes à Principle of Life governs the whole Man, directs our Practices, and whatſoever we do, is one way or other guided and determin'd by it. And the moſt proper way (next to the Grace of God, and frequent Prayer to Him) for the obtaining this, is to apply our ſelves honeſtly and carefully to the reading ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, as may rationally convince Us of the Truth of it. For tho' I conceive that no man, who will give himſelf Liberty to be ſerious, and to conſider, and whoſe Underſtanding is not clouded with vile Luſts and Affections, can poſſibly doubt of it; yet ſeeing we are too apt to forget and neglect, even what we know; ſeeing we want a Monitor and Remembrancer in the plaineſt things in the World. One would think no man need to be told, that he ſhall die; that he carries his Breath in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and is making haſte to the Duſt; and yet not withſtanding the ſenſible Decays which we feel in our ſelves; notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Experiments we daily ſee before our Eyes, how few are there who believe it;
<pb facs="tcp:100854:9"/>
ſo believe it, as to make it a Principle of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and behave themſelves as becomes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and periſhing Beings. The Doctrine of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is as evident as our Mortality, and yet the manifold Inſincerity of our Practices; the Fraud and Hypocriſie of our Dealings, the ſhameleſs Shifts and Artifices we hide our ſelves under, the impious and carnal Intriegues and Politicks that are ſo viſible among Men, are but too ſad and deplorable Inſtances, how much we need to be reminded and convinc'd, That God governs the World; for which Uſe and Purpoſe, the following Book is a moſt fit and proper Inſtrument, and Admirably ſuited for Conviction and perſwaſion; to ſatisſie the honeſt Enquirer, to ſtop the Mouths of Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, to confound the Obſtinate and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, and to quicken and awaken the Sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, negligent, and inconſiderate, which brings me to the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. Our Author's Excellent and Uſeful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling this Subject. This I confeſs, is a Copious Argument, and abundance may be ſaid of it: But I muſt confeſs with all, that it is a Subject fit for far abler Hands than mine, and it requires a Strength and Capacity equal to our Author, to give it its juſt Character. I am very ſenſible, that the beſt I can ſay, will diminiſh the Value, and baulk the Reader's Expectation, rather than advance it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be more juſt both to the Author and the Reader, as well as more modeſt in it ſelf, to let this Great point alone. Let the

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>SALVIAN</hi> to the holy Biſhop <hi>Salonius,</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth health in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. All thoſe Men, who have thought, that the exerciſing their Wits in Writing ſome Learned Work, might tend to the Improvement of Humane Life, have taken the greateſt Care, whether their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were uſeful and innocent, or unprofitable and wicked, to Adorn the Matter treated of with Choice of Expreſſions, and to add Luſtre to the Cauſe, they handled by the Beauty of their Stile. And therefore, in both ſorts of Learning, moſt of thoſe Writers, who have treated of worldly Affairs, have apply'd themſelves Chiefly to that Part, not much regarding the Truth or Worth of the Subject, if ſo be they expreſs'd themſelves upon it, either in ſmooth and taking Verſe, or in clean and perſpicuous Proſe. For generally in their Writings, they plead their own Cauſes, and being more ſolicitous of their own Applauſe, than of others advantages, they have not ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
<pb facs="tcp:100854:11"/>
to be ſound and inſtructive, as to be eſteem'd Eloquent and Learned. And therefore their Writings are either ſwell'd with Follies, or are Scandalous for Lying; are bedawb'd with beaſtly Words, or elſe defil'd with beaſtlier Things; ſo that the Chief Thing they aim'd at, being the Reputation of being thought Ingenious, when they ſpent ſo much time on ſuch unworthy Subjects; they ſeem'd to me, inſtead of having advanced the Credit of their Parts, much rather to have debas'd them. But I, who am a much greater lover of Things than Words, purſue Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, rather than Things plauſible; neither do I deſire to be commended for ſuch empty Gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws of the Times, but for the uſefulneſs and ſolidity of my Matter; I am not for uſing tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd Words in my poor Writings, but Phyſick and Remedies; not deſign'd to tickle the Ears of ſawntring, idle People, but to heal the ſick and wounded Conſcience; which, by God's Bleſſing, may both ways be of very great Advantage. If this Antidote of mine ſhall cure the ill Opinion ſome have taken up of our Great God, it will be of no ſmall Advantage that I have profited ſo many: But if it falls out otherwiſe, I ſhall not think I have loſt my Labour, having at leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do them good. For where good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and kind Endeavours do not meet with the intended Succeſs, in that Caſe the Will will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for the Deed. And ſo I will begin.</p>

               <p n="1">I. GOD Almighty is eſteem'd by many<note place="margin">Of God's Governing the World.</note> to neglect and diſregard Humane Affairs, that He neither protects the Righteous nor puniſhes the Wicked, and that That is the Reaſon why, generally ſpeaking, the Good are commonly miſerable in this World, and the Bad happy: Seeing we have to do with Chriſtians, the Word of God alone ought to be ſufficient to refute this; but becauſe many have ſomething in them of Heatheniſh Incredulity, it may be they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be alſo pleas'd with the Authorities of the greateſt and wiſeſt Heathens. I ſhall therefore ſhew, that even they who had not the true Religion, and ſo could not know God as they ought to do, becauſe utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that Law by which he is known, yet never dream'd of any ſuch Negligence or Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs

as this. Thus the Great <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whom Philoſopy her ſelf almoſt own'd for her Maſter, diſcourſing of the Nature and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence<note place="margin">

                  </note> of the Deity, ſays thus: <hi>That he is a Soul dilated and diffus'd thro' every part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, from which every living Creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its Being.</hi> How then can God be ſaid to neglect the World, when by this He ſhews ſo great Regard to it, that he diſpoſes Himſelf in every part and parcel of it? <hi>Plato</hi> and all his Followers declare God to be the Ruler of all Things. The Stoicks place him like a Pilot at the Helm of his Government. And how could they well form a more orthodox and religious Thought of the Love and Care of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty than by thus comparing Him to a Pilot? For their Meaning is, that as when a Ship is under Sail, the Director of it has always his Hand upon the Rudder; ſo God's Care of the World is continual and without intermiſſion: and as the One is entirely employ'd in all the Faculties of his Soul and Body in ordering his Tackle to the Winds, avoiding the Rocks, and obſerving of the Stars, ſo our good God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways graciouſly beholding, and by His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing, and moſt tenderly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately loving the whole Order of Beings. Hence alſo is that moſt Divine Saying of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s to this purpoſe, and which ſhews him to have been a very Great Philoſopher as well as Poet.</p>

Seeing then that even all thoſe who are without the true Religion have been forceably, and of neceſſity compell'd to own, that all Things are throughly ſeen, order'd, and govern'd by God: How comes it to paſs that ſome now a days do think Him to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent and regardleſs, who by His quickſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſees all things, diſpoſes of them by His Might, governs them by His Omnipotence, and preſerves them by his Goodneſs? I have ſhewn what the Chiefeſt Authors for Philoſophy and Eloquence have thought of the Majeſty and Government of the Great God; and I parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly took care to chooſe the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Maſters in both thoſe admirable Arts, that I might the more eaſily make appear, that all the reſt had the ſame Senſe of the Matter, or at leaſt, that they diſſented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Authority. And really, I cannot find any of a different Judgment, bating a few whimſical Epicureans, or Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizers, who as they have link'd Voluptuouſneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100854:15"/>
with Vertue, ſo they have joyn'd God with Sloath and Careleſneſs, that they might ſhew the World the effect of their Sentiments, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epicurean Vices as well as their Opinions.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I do not think my ſelf obliged in this<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the Bad, and the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Good, in this World: and how the Good cannot but he bleſs'd.</note> place to produce any Divine Teſtimony to prove ſo plain a Truth, chiefly becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures do ſo abundantly, and with ſuch Evidence contradict all the Reaſonings of the Wicked, that, as in the ſequel, I am anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their further Calumnies, I ſhall have an opportunity of more fully confuting what has been ſaid before. They urge then that all Things are neglected by God, becauſe He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhes the Bad nor protects the Good; and therefore the Condition of the better Sort is much the worſe in this World: for the Good are poor, but the Bad are rich; the Good weak, the Bad ſtrong; the Good mourning, the Wicked rejoycing; the Righteous miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſpis'd, the Wicked proſperous and advanc'd. I deſire to know in the firſt place of thoſe who either grieve at, or blame ſuch a Diſpenſation, whether they ſorrow for the Saints, that is, for true, and faithful Chriſtians, or for Hypocrites and Impoſtors? If for the Hypocrite, 'tis an idle Sorrow that grieves that a bad Man is not happy: For they who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wicked, would only be made worſe by Succeſs, and become rampant in their Villany. And therefore, for that very Reaſon they ſhould be more miſerable, that they may be leſs wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſince they vouch the Name of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for their diſhoneſt Gains, and make uſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100854:15"/>
of the Pretence of Sanctity only for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and ſordid Bargains; if their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were compar'd with their Iniquities, they are leſs miſerable than they deſerve; becauſe let them be in the greateſt Misfortunes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet their Wickedneſs will be ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than their Misfortunes And therefore we ought not by any means to be troubled that ſuch as theſe are not proſperous and happy: And much leſs ſhould we be afflicted for the Saints; for tho' they may ſeem to ignorant People to be miſerable, yet it is not poſſible for them to be otherwiſe than happy. 'Tis an idle thing for any one to judge other people miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable either in Sickneſs or Poverty, or in any other State in which they take themſelves to be happy. For no one is miſerable in another Man's Opinion but his own. And therefore they cannot be miſerable by the miſtaken Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another Man, who are truly happy in their own Conſciences. For I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that none are more happy than thoſe who act according to their own Wiſhes and Deſires. So then if the Good are in mean Condition, 'tis what they would be: Are they poor, they take delight in their Poverty: Are they without Ambition, 'tis becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it: Have they no Titles of Honour, 'tis becauſe they refuſe them: Do they mourn, they joy in Mourning; Are they weak, they<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor. 12. v.</hi> 10</note> rejoyce in Weakneſs. <hi>For when</hi> (ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> And he had good Reaſon to think ſo to whom God himſelf ſpeaks after this manner, <hi>My grace is</hi>

                  <hi>ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in weakneſs.</hi> We muſt therefore take care not to be griev'd at any Affliction from ſuch Weakneſs, ſince we ſee that 'tis the Original of Strength; For, be it what it will, they who are truly Good are to be eſteem'd happy; and in the greateſt Diſtreſs none are more happy than thoſe who are in ſuch Circumſtances as they would be. There are ſome indeed who purſue Baſeneſs and Obſcenity, and in their own Opinion think themſelves happy, becauſe they obtain what they deſire; but in reality they are not ſo; becauſe it was their Duty to deteſt thoſe things they deſired. But the truly Religious are far happier than all of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they both enjoy what they deſire, and cannot poſſibly be poſſeſs'd of better things than thoſe they do enjoy. So that Labour, Faſting, Poverty, Beggary, and Sickneſs are not troubleſome to all that bear them, but only to thoſe who bear them unwillingly; and whether they ſeem heavy or light, it proceeds from the opinion of him who bears them. For as there is nothing ſo eaſie but is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him who does it unwillingly, ſo there is nothing ſo heavy which will not ſeem light to him who undertakes it chearfully: unleſs it may be we think it was a Burden to thoſe antient Hero's the <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Eachard's</hi> Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, <hi>part. 1. p. 97.</hi> &amp;c.</note>

'Twas ſuch poor Magiſtrates as theſe that made a rich Common-wealth; but now a rich Government makes the Publick poor: tho' 'tis certainly the greateſt Stupidity and Frenzy, to think that private Eſtates can hold, when the Publick is Beggarly and Starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Who can for bear admiring the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100854:17"/>
deep reach of this Man, who thinks the Piety and Vertues of the Righteous worthy of ſuch mighty Rewards, that they ought in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life to be recompenſed with healthful and robuſt Conſtitutions! However I reply, not only on the behalf of this One, but of all good Men in general; and to the Queſtion, how good Men come to be weak and infirm, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer briefly; becauſe righteous Perſons labour to keep their Bodies under, leſt if they were vigorous and robuſt, it ſhould be difficult for them to be ſo good as they are. For I gueſs that all Mankind become ſtrong and luſty by eating and drinking plentifully: And on the other hand, they grow weakly by Abſtinence, Temperance, and Faſtings. And therefore what wonder is it if thoſe Men are weak and infirm, who refuſe to make uſe of the Means by which others become healthful and ſtrong. However they have good reaſon for ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>I keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

If he dreaded a robuſt Conſtitution, there is no good Chriſtian that would reaſonably covet it: And therefore this may paſs for a ſufficient Reaſon, why ſome devout Chriſtians are both infirm, and deſire to be ſo; but that is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to think that good Men are neglected by God, when for that very Reaſon, we truſt they are more belov'd by him. We read of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100854:18"/>
the Apoſtle <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he was of a very weak Conſtitution, but ſhall we thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he was neglected by our Lord, or that by reaſon of his Infirmity he was leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Chriſt, when the Reaſon of his being ſo was an Endeavour to pleaſe him? And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw him very much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by frequent Sickneſſes, he ſuffer'd him to<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim. 5.

Infirmities, and, I believe by this time you are of my Opinion too.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But it may be you'll ſay there are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">How <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Brother.</note> Things than theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſuffer grievous and cruel Hardſhips; that they are caſt into Priſons; that they are put to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that they are ſlain. All that is true. But in this what do we more than both the Prophets, who were carried into Captivity; and the Apoſtles alſo who endur'd Torments? And yet notwithſtanding we do certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God Almighty took extraordinary Care of them, even then, when they ſuffer'd thoſe Hardſhips for his Service. But perhaps for this very Reaſon you'll pretend to prove, that God does not regard the Things of this World now, but reſerves them entirely to his future Judgment; becauſe, for the moſt part, good Men ſuffer all the ill Things, and the Bad inflict them. I muſt confeſs the Aſſertion ſeems not to ſavour altogether of Infidelity, becauſe it does ſo plainly own God's future Judgment: But we maintain that Mankind are ſo to be judg'd by Chriſt, as that at the ſame time we believe that God does now diſpoſe and order all things as he thinks moſt fit and convenient; and we affirm that he will ſit as Judge in the future Judgment, but ſo that at the ſame time we teach, that he does always exerciſe Judgment in this World. For ſince God does always govern, he does always judge: becauſe Government it ſelf is the exerciſe of a Judicial Power. How many ways would you have this prov'd? Whether by Reaſon, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100854:19"/>
or Teſtimony? If by Reaſon; who is there ſo void of common Senſe, or ſo great a Stranger to the Truth we are diſcourſing of, that does not ſee and acknowledge, that the moſt beautiful Frame of the World, and the ineſtimable Magnificence of ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Things are all govern'd by the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Being which created them; that he that form'd the Elements is ſtill their Moderator, who, as at firſt he made all Things by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, ſo he ſtill rules them by his Providence and Wiſdom? Eſpecially when in tranſacting all our own Affairs, nothing can be manag'd without Prudence, and that every thing has it's Safety and Succeſs from Wiſdom and Forecaſt, as the Body has it's Life from the Soul. So that in this World not only Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Provinces, Civil and Military Affairs, but even the ſmalleſt Offices and private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, nay the very Beaſts and the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and contemptible of our Domeſtick Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are not to be manag'd without Conduct, and a prudent and orderly Diſpoſition. And without doubt 'tis the Will of God that thus it ſhould be, that all Mankind might rule the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts alloted them after the Pattern ſet them by him, who ſo wiſely ſteers the whole. But, ſay you, things were thus order'd and diſpos'd in the beginning of the Creation; But when God had made the Univerſe, and perfected all things therein, he abandon'd all further Care of earthly Matters, and renounc'd it. I warrant you to avoid the Drudgery, he remov'd it far enough from him, or was aſraid

               <p>The very Reaſon of all Prayer is deſtroy'd, if we have not hope of obtaining what we ask.

Life: and he would never have given ſuch a Command, if he were not confident that we ſhould obtain them. How therefore does any one think that God's ears are open to Prayers offer'd for the Good things of the other Life, but are clos'd and ſhut up to thoſe of this Life? Or how come we in our Prayers in the Church to beg of God preſent Security, if we think we are not heard at all? There are therefore no Prayers to be offer'd for our preſent Safety and Proſperity, but rather that the Modeſty of the Petition may procure Audience for him that prays, it may be convenient to addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus: <hi>Lord, we ask not for Proſperity in this Life, nor for the good things of this preſent time, we know thy ears are ſhut up and baritaded to ſuch Prayers, ſo as thou canſt not hear them; all that we deſire is, that thou wouldeſt be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to us after death in the World to come.</hi> Suppoſe now ſuch a Prayer as this were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and uſeful, yet how would it conſiſt with Reaſon and good Senſe? For if God has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred himſelf from all manner of regard of the Affairs of this World, and ſhut his ears againſt all Petitioners whatever, certainly he who does not hear us when we pray for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good things, does not hear us when we crave thoſe that are future; unleſs we imagine that according to the difference of the Petition, Chriſt does either afford or refuſe his ears, that is, that when we deſire the good Things of this Life he ſhuts them, and opens them when we beg the future. But no more on this head: becauſe all theſe Pretences are ſo very ſrivolous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100854:20"/>
and fooliſh, that we had need take care that we do not affront the Divinity, whilſt we are endeavouring to reſcue and preſerve his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Reverence and Regard we owe the Divine Majeſty is ſo awful and tremendous, that we ought not only to deteſt whatever is ſpoken againſt his Religion, but alſo to take all the Care that may be, that what we our ſelves offer in it's defence be done with the greateſt Caution and Circumſpection imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Well then, if it be folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to think that the Divine Goodneſs deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all Care of Humane Affairs, for that reaſon, 'tis plain, that he does not diſregard them; if he does not diſregard them, then he directs them: If he directs and orders them, for that very Reaſon 'tis manifeſt, that he judges them, for 'tis not poſſible to ſuppoſe a Government, where the Governour is not inveſted with a Power of Judging.</p>

For in this particular, that God accepted the Sacrifice of the one, and rejected that of the other, he did moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently declare the Righteouſneſs of the one, and the Iniquity of the other. But this is the leaſt of the Caſe. When therefore <hi>Cain,</hi> in order to accompliſh his deſign'd Villany, had drawn his Brother abroad, he committed the Fact in the moſt lonely place, in this equally
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100854:21"/>
impious and fooliſh, that could imagine he might perform the deteſtable curſed Deed, if he avoided humane Eyes, and yet durſt murder his Brother in the face of the Almighty: which makes me believe that he was of the opinion that many are now a days, that God does not at all regard things here below, and ſo does not ſee the Naughtineſs of cruel and ungodly Men: and one can't doubt it by his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when after the horrid Deed, being call'd upon by God, he deny'd that he knew any thing at all of his Brother's Murder; he thought God Almighty knew ſo little of the Matter, that he might conceal the unnatural Fact with a Lye. But he found the contrary to his coſt. For he, who when he committed the Murder, thought God did not ſee, was made ſenſible that he did ſee when he was condemn'd for it. I deſire therefore to be ſatisfied in this place, by thoſe who deny that Humane Affairs are either regarded, govern'd, or adjudg'd by God; whether what I have at preſent urged, proves the contrary or no? It ſeems to me, that he who is preſent at a Sacrifice, is not abſent from it, and that he ſhews the Exerciſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who after ſuch Sacrifice, inflicts a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon <hi>Cain:</hi> that he ſhews Care and Regard, who demands an account of the Slain at the hands of the Murderer: and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes Judgment who paſſes a righteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on the wretched Aggreſſor. From all which, it is very natural to make this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>we ſhould not by any maans think it ſtrange that good Men now a days ſuffer Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,

ſince at that time Heaven permitted the firſt Saint on Earth to be Barbarouſly murdered.</hi> But for what reaſon it was permitted, the ſhortneſs of a humane underſtanding will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to reach, neither is it my Buſineſs at preſent to enquire: It is ſufficient to my purpoſe, that I prove that ſuch Occurrences as theſe come not to paſs, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or notice of God Almighty, but that they are permitted ſo to be in his Providence and Wiſdom. Neither can we by any means eſteem that thing to be unjuſt in which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the Sentence of Heaven to have paſſed: becauſe whatſoever is the will of God muſt of neceſſity be the perfection of Juſtice. It is not for us to Cenſure God's doings as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; Man's Underſtanding was never deſign'd to comprehend the Compaſs of Divine Juſtice. But to return whence we digreſs'd.</p>

For I am of Opinion, that he did not only barely judge them, but paſſed, as it were, a double Sentence upon them: Becauſe, when on the one hand, he preſerv'd the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, he ſhew'd himſelf merciful and their Rewarder; and on the orher hand by his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the Ungodly, he ſhew'd the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Juſtice. But perhaps theſe things, becauſe tranſacted, as it were in another Age before the Flood, may not have ſo great Weight among ſome of the weaker Sort, as they ought to have: as tho' there were ſome other God at that time, or elſe, that He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grew ſullen, and would not take the ſame Trouble that he had done before. I could by Divine Aſſiſtance, prove what I have ſaid thro' all Ages ſince the Flood, but the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Number will not admit it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſome few of the moſt conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may ſuffice: For ſince 'tis beyond all doubt, That the God of the firſt Men and of their Poſterity, is the very ſame, that muſt be expected in the Government of the Poſterity, which we find by Inſtances to be true in that of our Fore-fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But leſt theſe things, which were given him, might ſeem to be purely the Effects of God's Bounty, and not any Encouragement of his Obedience; he who was thus proſperous and ſucceſsful, afterward underwent the Tryal of Adverſity. For he afterward liv'd in Trouble, Hazards, and Dread of his Life; was tormented with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling from place to place, fatigu'd in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, every where affronted; depriv'd of his Wife: God order'd his Son to be Sacrific'd the Father obeys, and offers him, as far as was poſſible in the Sincerity of his Intention.

In all theſe Tranſactions 'tis eaſie to obſerve, that God was an Overſeer, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter, a Guide; was Solicitous, a Promiſer, a Protector, a Rewarder, a Prover, a Patron, a Revenger, and a Judge. He was an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, when out of many he choſe him alone

whom he ſaw to be better than the reſt: An inviter, when he call'd him from his own Country: A guide, when he brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unknown Place: He was ſolicitous when he viſited him under the Tree: A promiſer, when he aſſur'd him of Things to come: A protector, when he protected him among a ſtrange People: A rewarder, when he enrich'd him. A Patron and advancer, when he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him above all: A revenger, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd him of his Adverſaries: And a Judge becauſe in the Act of his Vengeance, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.

But why ſhould he uſe ſuch an Expreſſion, as that the Sins of Men <hi>do cry?</hi> Becauſe God ſays, that his ears are wounded with the Cries of Sins, to haſten the Puniſhment of the Sinner: And a huge and mighty Cry it muſt be, when the long-ſuffering of God is ſo overcome by the Cry of Sins, that he is forc'd to inflict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Sinner. The Lord does therefore here ſhew how unwillingly he inflicts Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the greateſt Trangreſſors, when he ſays, that <hi>the Cry of Sodom is come up to him,</hi> as much as if he had ſaid, my Mercy does mightily incline me to ſpare them, but the Cry of their Sins does even force me to puniſh

So that by this preſent one, God ſeems to declare the Dreadful future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when upon a moſt unrighteous People he ſent a ſort of Hell from Heaven.

with Riches: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> repents, draws together his Army, overtakes the departed, Encamps, is parted by the Cloud, the Sea is dry'd up, <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſes through, is deliver'd by the kind ſufferance of the friendly Waves, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſues, the Sea rowls upon him, and he is overwhelm'd in the Waters. I think in this whole Affair, there does appear the manifeſt Judgment of God; and not only his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo his Long-ſuffering and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, For 'tis an Argument of great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, that the wicked <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were often ſmitten, as 'tis of Judgment, that the Perverſe and Impenitent were at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd. Well, after this Series of Things and Actions, <hi>Iſrael</hi> being Conquerour without a Battle, enters the Wilderneſs, travels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Journey, ſojourns without a Road, God his Leader, the Hoſt of Heaven his Fellow-Soldiers, and heavenly Bodies his Guides, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the moving Pillar, cloudy by Day, and fiery by Night, changing its Colour and Complexion, as fitted beſt the change of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seaſon, that it might ſet off the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Day by it's ſhady Obſcurity, and enlighten the darkneſs of the Night by it's ſhining Splendour.

To this add God himſelf deſcending, purely to inſtruct them, and the Son of God appearing viſible to the eyes of Mortals, the mighty Numbers of the common Sort admitted to be familiar with their God, and honour'd with his Friendſhip.

I would fain know how he could better have expreſs'd the Care of his Government, what greater Tenderneſs could he poſſibly ſhew them, than by Reſpecting them ſo much in this Life, as to allow them a ſort of Anticipation of the Bleſſedneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</p>

a Soul eſcaped? How comes it to paſs that in that caſe God would deſtroy the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Offenders, but in this only ſome part of them? Becauſe God is plentiful both in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice, and of his Eſſential goodneſs forgives many times, as well as exerciſes Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Vindication of his Juſtice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that Caſe his Juſtice took place, that by puniſhing all the Offenders, it might tend to the Reformation of all that ſaw or heard it: But in this he exerciſes Mercy, leſt a whole People ſhould be deſtroy'd. And yet when he had uſed them with ſo much Compaſſion, and ſaw the often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>repeated Scourging of a part only of the offending Multitude had ſo little Succeſs, at the laſt he utterly deſtroy'd them all: The Conſideration of which ſhould both make us tremble, and ſpur us on to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, leſt we, who neglect to reform our ſelves from their Example, come to the ſame miſerable End that they did. For what became of them is plain beyond all doubt; for ſeeing that the Chief Deſign of bringing the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was purely that they might poſſeſs the Land of Promiſe, only two holy and good Men, of all that vaſt Body entred into it.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of God's Governing the World; How God's Ears are always open to the Righteous; How Great things <hi>David</hi> ſuffered. An Example of Repentance, and the Advantages obtained thereby.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Examples I have before produced,<note place="margin">Of God's governing the World.</note> are ſufficient to prove that our God is ever a moſt ſolicitous Regarder, a moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governour, and a moſt juſt Judge. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, ſome of the weaker Sort may yet think; if things are now order'd by God as they were heretofore in thoſe days; How comes it about, that bad Men prevail, and that the Good are in diſtreſs; in thoſe days the Wicked felt the weight of God's Wrath, and the Righteous his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but now the Righteous in ſome ſort ſeem to experience his Wrath, and the Wicked his Favour? I ſhall give an Anſwer to all this preſently: But now, ſince in the foregoing Book I engag'd to prove theſe three Things, to wit, The <hi>Preſence</hi> of God, His <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> by theſe three Topicks of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Examples,</hi> and <hi>Teſtomony;</hi> and having
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100854:32"/>
already gone thro' the two firſt, it remains that I manifeſt the ſame by <hi>Teſtimony:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in ſtrictneſs the Examples I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced already ought to paſs for Teſtimony, for that is rightly call'd Teſtimony, whereby the Truth of things is prov'd. But which of the abovementioned Three ſhall I begin to prove firſt by this Teſtimony, whether God's Preſence, His Governing, or His Judging? His Preſence, I think, whether he govern or judge; for without doubt, he ought to be preſent before he can exerciſe either the one or the other. The holy Scripture in it's ſacred Pages ſpeaks thus: <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> Here you have him preſent, here you have him beholding and watching in every place by his Care and Providence: For therefore is it ſaid, that he conſiders both the Good and the Bad, to ſhew that nothing can be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, who ſo narrowly views every thing. But for a further Underſtanding of the Matter, hear what the ſame holy Spirit teſtifies in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of Scripture. <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him.—To deliver</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 33. <hi>V.</hi> 17. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>their Soul from death, and to feed them in the time of Dearth.</hi> Here is a reaſon given why God is ſaid to behold good Men, namely, that he may preſerve and protect them. For 'tis from the Propitious eye of Heaven that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ought to date their preſervation. So the ſame holy Spirit in another place: <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 34. <hi>V.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their Prayers.</hi> See here with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100854:32"/>
how much goodneſs the holy Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents God dealing with his People. For in that it ſays, <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,</hi> it ſhews the Affection of the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beholder: in that <hi>his ears are open unto their Prayers,</hi> is demonſtrated the Liberality and Bounty of the Hearer.</p>
               <p>In the Expreſſion that God's ears are always<note place="margin">How God's ears are always o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Righteous.</note> ready to receive the Prayers of the Righteous is meant, not only bare Hearing, but a kind of Condeſcenſion likewiſe.</p>
               <p>But how are God's ears always open to the Prayers of the Righteous? How, but becauſe God always hears, and always grants their Petitions as ſoon as ask'd: Our Lord's ears are always ready to hear the Prayers of his Saints, always attentive: And, Oh how trebly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy ſhould we be, were we as ready to obey and do the Will of God, as we read here, that God is ready and willing to hear us! But you'll ſay, it may be, that what we read of God's beholding the Juſt, does not help my Cauſe at all: Becauſe that cannot be call'd a general Beholding, which is reſtrain'd by a particular Favour to the Juſt only. It is but a little before where the Text is produc'd, which ſays; <hi>The eyes of the Lord behold the evil and the good:</hi> However, if a further Proof be deſir'd, mind what follows, for thus it ſubjoyns, <hi>The countenance of the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>them that do evil, to root out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them from the earth.</hi> Here certainly is no room left for Complaint, that God do's not alſo behold the Unjuſt: but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100854:33"/>
this general View he takes of both, yet he beholds them with a vaſt difference as to their Merits; he beholds the Good, that he may preſerve them, but the Bad, that he may deſtroy them; among whom you, who have the Courage to deny that God beholds Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, muſt expect your ſhare; For know that you are not only ſeen by the Almighty, but acknowledge that your deſtruction is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For ſince <hi>the Countenance of the Lord is upon them that do evil, to root out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them from the Earth,</hi> it is of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that you, who wickedly deny the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of God to behold any thing, ſhould perceive the Wrath of the Beholder in your Deſtruction. And this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt thing, which is of <hi>God's Preſence in,</hi> and his beholding of, Humane Affairs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let us ſee now whether he who beholds them, governs them; certainly ſo, for the main Reaſon of His Beholding is in order to His Governing; for he do's not regard and mind them, only in order to neglect them, when we underſtand that he do's not neglect by the very Act of his minding them; eſpecially, ſince holy Writ witneſſes, as above, that God beholds the Wicked in order to their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Good for their Preſervation. And in this very Thing the Diſpenſation of God's Government is manifeſted; for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Government do's entirely conſiſt in this, to deal with every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man according to the meaſure of his Deſerts. But let us view a plainer Teſtimony in this Matter. The holy

                  <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The word <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſeeing God,</hi> whom yet all faithful Chriſtians may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in their Heart and by Faith: and altho' God be the Ruler of all Men, yet thoſe are ſaid more peculiarly to be govern'd by him, who do more peculiarly deſerve the Benefit of the Divine ear. So that you, whoever you are, if ſo be you are a Chriſtian, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity believe your ſelf to be govern'd by God. But if you do not believe, with other Chriſtians, that you are govern'd by God; you muſt of neceſſity know that you are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all other Chriſtians. But if you deſire to be inform'd, as we have hinted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, what is the State of all Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and not of the Chriſtians in particular, the Holy Scripture will ſolve your Doubt, which affirms, that all things are continually and without intermiſſion, order'd and govern'd by God. For <hi>he loveth Council and Diſcipline.</hi> Nor is there any other God whoſe Care is<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wiſd. 12. v.</hi> 15, 18.</note> Univerſal. <hi>For ſo much then as thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thy ſelf, thou ordereſt all things righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;—and ordereſt us with great favour.</hi> Here you ſee God always diſpoſing Affairs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways governing; and beſides, there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place a Declaration of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but alſo an Exaltation of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For in the words, <hi>Thou ordereſt us,</hi> is the Force of God's Power, but in thoſe <hi>with great favour</hi> is the height of Humane Honour. So in the Prophet; <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100854:34"/>
earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> And He himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer. 23. V.</hi> 24.</note> why he fills all things: <hi>Becauſe I am with you,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and will ſave you.</hi> God<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer. 42. v.</hi> 11.</note> do's not only barely declare his Power, and his filling all things, but ſhews the Efficacy and Benefit of ſuch his filling. For the Divine filling brings this Advantage with it, that it ſaves every thing which it fills. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts 17. v.</hi> 28.</note> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſays: <hi>In him we live and move and have our Being.</hi> Certainly he is more than a bare Diſpoſer of Life, in whom is the Principal of Motion of the Creature that lives. For he do's not ſay that we are mov'd <hi>by him,</hi> but <hi>in him,</hi> thereby informing us, that the Subſtance of us All is engraffed in the Divine Perfections: Becauſe we plainly live in him from whom we receive even our very Exiſtence. So our Saviour himſelf in the Goſpel: <hi>Loe I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. 28. v.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>even unto the end of the world.</hi> He did not only ſay that he was with us, but that he was with us <hi>always.</hi> And do you, ungrateful Man, venture to ſay, that he who is always with us, do's neither regard nor care for us? What, do's he ſtay with us for no other end but to deſpiſe and neglect us? How are theſe Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, that he ſhould afford us his Preſence out of Love, and yet hate us by his Neglect? For he ſays, <hi>Loe I am with you always even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world.</hi> We put a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Meaning on the loving-kindneſs of God, by ſlandering him for neglecting us, when at the ſame time he openly declares that he do's never leave us. He would by this ſhew us,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100854:34"/>
that he would never depart from us in Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Protection, becauſe his Preſence ſhould be always with us: And we convert this Divine Charity into Contempt of us, and change theſe Marks of Love into Arguments of Hatred. For this His ſaying, that <hi>he would be always with us,</hi> we make a Teſtimony of Hatred rather than of Love. For if the Lord had ſaid he ſhould be abſent, there would be leſs Reaſon to accuſe him of diſregard in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. It ſhews a much greater Slight and Contempt, if he ſhould always neglect us, who always remain'd with us; 'tis great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Hatred to us, if he ſhould ſtay with us only for this End, always to let us have his Preſence, and yet never to love us. Far be it from us to have ſuch Thoughts of the moſt Loving and merciful God, that he ſhould be always near us, only that by ſuch nearneſs, he might ſlight and neglect us the more; and far be it from us to ſpeak it. I am perſwaded there is ſcarce ſuch a Varlet to be found among all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that deſires to be near another Man, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he do's not love him; and that would covet to enjoy his Company, meerly that he might have the better opportunity to hate and deſpiſe him. Let therefore Humane Nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inform or convince us: For if we do not deſire to be with any Man, unleſs ſuch as we have Reſpect for; and becauſe we have ſuch reſpect, we endeavour that our <hi>Company</hi> may be as <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>advantageous</hi> to him we do ſo love: How come we then to take away that from God, which you muſt allow to a wicked Man, and to depreſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100854:35"/>
him beneath, even the very worſt of Men: that he ſhould tell us, that he would be always with us, that he might uſe us with the greater Scorn and Contempt? But enough of this.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It remains that, ſince I have prov'd by<note place="margin">How great things <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Teſtimonies of holy Writ, that all things are order'd and govern'd by God, I ſhould ſhew in like manner, that many things in this world have been adjudged by him. When holy <hi>David</hi> was abus'd and affronted by <hi>Nabal</hi> the Carmelite, he forbore to reſent the Injury, and had his Cauſe immediately avenged by God. When therefore his Adverſary was dead, and ſmitten by the hand of Heaven, he ſpoke after this manner, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam. 25. v.</hi> 39.</note> 
                  <hi>that hath pleaded the Cauſe of my Reproach from the hand of Nabal.</hi> When his Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Perſecutor, and turn'd him out of his Kingdom, the Lord as Judge, in a ſhort time, avenged his Cauſe; and not only barely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged it, but in a much higher degree than he, in whoſe Vindication it was, would have had it; that God might ſhew that the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done to the Injur'd and Oppreſſed, is more grievous to Himſelf than to thoſe that bear it. For he who puniſhes beyond the Deſire of the Injur'd Party, ſhews plainly, that ſuch overplus of Correction is in his own Quarrel. His undutiful Son therefore, being ſnapp'd up by the growing Gallows, holy Writ relates the Account then given of this Puniſhment that fell upon him from above, Thus: <hi>Tidings, my Lord the King: for the</hi>

Here you ſee, not only from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things and Examples, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; but alſo from the very Name and Term of <hi>Judgment,</hi> how the Scriptures prove by holy Witneſſes, that God do's Judge even in this preſent World. But you think, it may be, this was a ſingular Inſtance, a particular Favour granted to ſo Great and Good a Man, that God by his Judgments ſhould deliver him from his Adverſaries. The whole day would not be ſufficient for me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

However, that you may plainly diſcern, that he do's not paſs his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Judgment ſo much for the ſake of Perſons, as the Juſtice of their Cauſes; pray mark how the ſame God, as Judge, who ſo conſtantly gave Sentence for <hi>David,</hi> has often in other Caſes given it againſt him: and this not in the Concern of Numbers of People, or which perhaps might ſeem to incline God Almighty, that of holy and good Men, but in the Cauſe of a ſingle Perſon, and he an Alien too, and where in all probability he would not have born ſo hard on ſo great a Man, if his Cauſe had not condemn'd him.

So that you who, I ſuppoſe, comfort and ſolace your ſelf in your Wickedneſs with the hopes that God do's not at all weigh any of our Actions, do by this find, that Chriſt plainly ſees you, and is ready to pour down Vengeance on your Head: for 'twas not poſſible for <hi>David,</hi> a holy Man, to conceal one ſingle Sin, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the privacy imaginable, nor by the Merit of all the good Works he had ever done, to free himſelf from preſent Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And thefore he did not ſay, becauſe thou haſt done this Thing, thou ſhalt feel God's future Judgment, and ſhalt be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100854:36"/>

And what<note place="margin">Example of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> was the Effect of this? Why, the Criminal acknowledges his Fault, is humbled, ſuffers Compunction, Confeſſes, Mourns, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, throws by his Royal Gemms, puts off his Maſſy Embroider'd Robes, uſes no Purple, lays by his Diadem, changes his Habit and his Heart, caſts off the Crown with all its Gay Attendance, becomes a formal Penitent, and flies for Refuge to a mean Attire, is waſted with Faſting, and dry'd up with Thirſt, is drain'd with Weeping, and ſhut up in Secret. And yet ſo Renowned a Prince as this, greater in Piety than in Power, extraordinary deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all his former Conduct, when he prays and ſues with ſo much Court, yet cannot be forgiven. However he gain'd that mighty<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> Great Advantage from his Repentance, that he was not adjudged to Eternal Puniſhment, altho' he could not eſcape in this World. For after all, thus ſaith the Prophet to him: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100854:37"/>
brought him into the World, the Occaſion of throwing him out of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This therefore was the firſt ſtep of the Divine Judgment; the firſt, but not the only One, for there follow'd a whole Series of Troubles and Afflictions, and a continued Chain of Misfortunes never after departed from his Family. <hi>Tamar</hi> is raviſh'd by <hi>Amnon:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Amnon</hi> is murder'd by <hi>Abſalom:</hi> A Grand wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs was committed by one Brother, but yet a greater by the other in Revenge of it: And <hi>David</hi> the Father a Sufferer in both their Crimes; two of his Sons tranſgreſs, and he loſes three Children by the Offence, <hi>Tamar</hi> loſes her Virginity, and in <hi>Amnon</hi>'s Murder, the loſs of <hi>Abſalom</hi> is bemoan'd. And 'tis not eaſie to gueſs which of his two Sons Loſs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father took moſt to heart; whether his who fell by his Brother's hand in this World, or his who periſh'd eternally by his own in the other. And now according to the Word of God, after this there follows a whole heap of extraordinary Misfortunes; the Father is for a long time beſet by his Son, is abdicated and driven out of his Kingdom, and to ſave his Life, ſneaks off like a Fugitive. The Son would puzzle half Mankind to tell whether he were more lewd or cruel; For when he fail'd to kill his Father by baſe Patricide, he throws Dirt upon him by Inceſt, and by ſuch ſort of Inceſt, which beſide the Sin; was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly deſign'd to expreſs and exalt the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany; for that very Wickedneſs; which is moſt abominable, tho committed with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

Secrecy, this Perſecutor of his Father acted openly: that not only his abſent Father might be diſhonour'd by the prodigious Sin, but alſo the eyes of the whole City be defiled with his publick Inceſt. If to this we add the manner of his Flight, how hard it was when ſo Great a King, of ſo Great Fame, greater than all his neighbour Kings, and above the World, fled from his own Children and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with ſcarce a Servant to attend him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now, in compariſon of what he was lately, a Beggar and deſerted; flying in Fear, in Diſgrace, in Sorrow, going (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſays) <hi>with his Head cover'd and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot:</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. Where are they now that deny that God regards Humane Affairs? Behold how often the Scriptures have inform'd us in the perſon of this one Man, not only that God do's regard them, but that he do's adjudge them likewiſe. And to what end do's it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate all theſe things, but that we might know and underſtand that God's Juſtice and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100854:38"/>
Judgment in this World will ever be the ſame they have been? And we therefore read that holy and good Men were formerly chaſtis'd by God's Judgment, that we might know that we our ſelves are to be judged by God as Judge, even in this World: For as God is everlaſting, ſo is his Juſtice: As the Lord's Omnipotence will never fail, ſo neither will his Judgment ever change: as God is of right eternal, ſo his Juſtice has no end. And therefore all thoſe who are remarkable for their Piety in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, when they were in any immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger, or cruel Perſecution, always call for God's preſent Judgment: So ſays the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. 43. v.</hi> 1.</note> juſt Man in the <hi>Pſalm: Give Sentence with me, O God, and defend my Cauſe againſt the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People:</hi> which, leſt it might be apply'd to God's future Judgment, he adds, <hi>Deliver me from the deceitful and wicked Man.</hi> He certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires God's preſent Judgment, who prays to be deliver'd from the hands of his Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: and being conſcious of the goodneſs of his Cauſe, he do's not ſo much pray for the help and aſſiſtance of God, as his Judgment; becauſe the beſt aſſiſtance that can be given to a good Cauſe is, when it is rightly judg'd. So in another place very plainly, <hi>Plead thou</hi>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100854:38"/>
hand upon the Shield, and ſeiſe the Sword, the Shield for Protection, and the Sword for Revenge. Not that God in the exerciſe of his Judgment ſtands in need of any ſuch Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, but becauſe in this World the names of ſuch frightful Things are the Inſtruments of frightful Judgments, he ſpeaks to a Humane Underſtanding in the Language of Humane things: becauſe he pray'd to be judg'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of his Adverſaries, he expreſs'd the Greatneſs of the Divine Vengeance by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of earthly Cruelty. Laſtly, this ſame Prophet does elſewhere declare the difference there is between God's preſent and his future Judgment. For he mentions the exerciſe of a<note place="margin">Pſal. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> preſent Judgment in theſe words: <hi>Thou ſittest upon the Throne who judgeſt righteouſly:</hi> And of the<note place="margin">Pſal. 96. <hi>v</hi> 13.</note> future and eternal Judgment, he ſays, <hi>He ſhall judge the World righteouſly.</hi> And again, <hi>He ſhall judge the People in Truth.</hi> Here he uſes the very Words of the preſent and future time or tenſe, to diſtinguiſh the time of each Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That he might ſhew the preſent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he puts, <hi>Thou judgeſt or thou doeſt judge;</hi> and that he might diſtinguiſh the Future from the Preſent, he adds, <hi>He ſhall or he will judge.</hi> And thus I have ſufficiently prov'd God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, his Government, and Judgment, by Reaſon, Examples, and Teſtimony: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince the following Diſcourſes tend all to the ſame Purpoſe. Now if it ſhall pleaſe the Great God, whoſe Cauſe I am pleading, to grant me Strength to go thro' with it: I ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to produce what the Adverſaries uſe to object againſt it, and at the ſame time Confute them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THUS far all is well, the Foundations of the Work are laid, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with a Pious Deſign, and undertaken purely out of the Love and Duty I owe the Great God; and therefore they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not laid in mouldring Mortar, nor raiſed with fading, Stone, but ſtrong as Heavens Expence, and firm as God's own Art and Skill can make them; ſuch as He himſelf ſpeaks of in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which, <hi>neither boiſterous Winds can ſhake,</hi>

                  <hi>nor Deluges overturn, nor waſhing Rains throw down.</hi> For ſince the Hand, as it were, of the Sacred Volumes, has order'd the Work, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100854:39"/>
the Cement of the holy Scriptures has join'd it, 'tis of neceſſity that, thro' the Aſſiſtance of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, this ſhould be as laſting as the firm Materials which compoſe the Building: And therefore it gains this Strength from its Originals, and can never be pull'd down ſo long as they are ſafe. For as in earthly Buildings none can throw down the Walls, unleſs he moves the Stones and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſo none can ſtir the Building I have raiſed, unleſs he firſt deſtroys that of which it is made and perfected: which being not to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any means whatever, I may very well preſume upon the Stability of the Building, ſince it's Bottom is laid on immortal Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then is, ſince Things are thus,<note place="margin">The State of the Good much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than tke Bad.</note> if all things in this World are order'd by the Care, Government, and Judgment of God, How comes the Condition of <note n="a" place="margin">

And why among our ſelves is the State of the Good much harder than that of the Bad? Why are the Righteous caſt down, and the Wicked luſty and ſtrong? Why do's all the World ſubmit to wicked Men, and chiefly wicked Powers? I could with Reaſon and Conſiſtency anſwer, that I know not the Secrets of God, and am altogether a ſtranger to his Counſels:<note place="margin">Of the juſt judgments and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of God, which are unknown.</note> The Words of Scripture are ſufficient Proof to me of this Reaſon. God himſelf ſays, as I have prov'd in the foregoing Books, that he does both Behold, Govern, and Judge all things. <hi>If you would know what you are to hold to, you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100854:40"/>
have the holy Scriptures: 'tis the Perfection of Reaſon to ſtick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to what you read there.</hi> But I deſire you would not ask me for what Reaſon God does the Things we are ſpeaking of. I am but a meer Man, I do not underſtand the Secrets of God Almighty, I dare not pry into them, and therefore dread to attempt it; becauſe I take it to be no leſs than a Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Raſhneſs to endeavour to know more of thoſe Matters than you are permitted to do. It ought to ſatisfie you that God has declared, that all things are diſpos'd and order'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Why do you ask me why one is Great, another Mean, why one is Miſerable, another Happy, one Strong, another Weak? What the Cauſe is, why God orders Things thus, I do not underſtand, but it is inſtead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Reaſons to me, that I can ſhew that all this is order'd by God himſelf. For as God is infinitely above all Humane Reaſon, ſo it is to me more than all the Reaſons in the World, that I know that God does it. So that in this Matter there is no need of producing any thing new; for when we ſay that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, 'tis as ſufficient as a Million of Reaſons. Neither ſhould we in theſe Caſes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God's Will, take the Liberty of Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this is Juſt, and that is unjuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever you ſee, and are convinc'd of to be done by God, you ought of neceſſity to confeſs to be the higheſt Juſtice. Now all this might be quickly and with ſtrength of Reaſon ſaid concerning God's Government and Judgment. For 'tis not at all neceſſary that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100854:40"/>
I ſhould offer to prove that by Arguments, which is more than prov'd, ſince God has been pleas'd to declare that it is ſo. And therefore, when we read, that God has ſaid, that he does always behold the Earth, for that very Reaſon we prove that he does behold it, ſince He himſelf has told us, that he does ſo. So when we read, that he rules all things that he has made, we are from thence certain that he does rule them, becauſe he teſtifies that he does ſo. Thus, when we read that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth all things by a preſent Judgment, 'tis manifeſt and plain to us, that he does exerciſe ſuch Judgment, becauſe we have his Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. All other, to wit, Humane Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtand in need of Reaſons and Witneſſes to ſupport them: But God's Word is its own witneſs; For whatſoever is ſpoken by perfect Truth it ſelf, muſt of neceſſity be a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Teſtimony of Truth. However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, ſince God has been pleas'd by the holy Scriptures, to give us a Knowledge, as it were, of the Secrets of his own Mind, for the Oracles of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are in ſome Senſe the Mind of God, I ſhall not conceal whatſoever God has thought fit ſhould be either known or declared by his Servants: only one thing I deſire to know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin, whether I am to argue with Chriſtians, or with Pagans: If it be with Chriſtians, I do not at all doubt but I ſhall prove my Point; but if with Pagans, I ſcorn to offer at it, not that I want ſufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but that I have no hopes they will be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100854:41"/>
ever the better for what I ſay. For pains and labour are thrown away upon an obſtinate Hearer that will never be convinc'd. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſince I believe there is no one who goes under the Name of a Chriſtian, who would not willingly be thought one, I will deal with him as with a Chriſtian: And altho' any one ſhould be tainted with impious and paganiſh Infidelity, 'tis enough for me, if what I offer, be approv'd of by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Your Objection then is, how come we Chriſtians who believe in God to be more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable than other Men? I could give a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to your Queſtion, from the Words the Apoſtle uſes to the Churches: <hi>That</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ. 3. v.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>no man ſhould be moved by affliction, for your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto.</hi> And therefore ſeeing the Apoſtle tells, that we are call'd by God that we ſhould endure Afflictions, Miſery and Diſtreſs; what wonder is it, that we ſuffer all manner of Evil, ſince it is the greateſt part of our Warfare to do ſo? But there are very few who will reliſh this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but rather think, that as the Chriſtians are more religious than other Sects, ſo they ought to receive at the hand of God, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their Faith, that they ſhould be more Powerful than other Men: For the preſent let us aquieſce in this Opinion and Judgment:<note place="margin">Of what Faith is.</note> And let us conſider what it is to believe in God Faithfully. For we who would have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Faith in this World to be ſo very Ample, ought at leaſt to beſtow ſome Thoughts
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100854:41"/>
what Sort of Believing or Faith this ought to be. What then is Faith or the Act of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? I take it to be that a Man faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe in Chriſt, that is, that he be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, and ſincerely keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For as the Servants and Stewards of Great Men, who are entruſted with all their Maſter's Goods and Stores, can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd faithful if they ſquander what was committed to their Care; ſo are Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men unfaithful if they ſpoil the Goods aſſign'd them by their God. But you ask me, it may be, what thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Goods are that God has put in a Chriſtian's Truſt? What can they be but all thoſe things by which we gain our Belief; that is, thoſe very Things by which we are Chriſtians? As firſt the Law, then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thirdly the Goſpels, fourthly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thus the</hi> Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Laying on of Hands are join'd.</note> Writings, and laſtly the Gift of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the Grace of holy Baptiſm, and the <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;</hi> ſo call'd by the Fathers from the Anointing at that time uſed in it.</note> Unction of ſacred Chriſm: For as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly among the <hi>Jews,</hi> God's own People, when, after the Judges, the Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Regal, God uſed to advance ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb. 6. v.</hi> 2.</note> choſen Perſons to the Throne by the Ceremony of Anointing; ſo all Chriſtians, when, after the <note n="c" place="margin">After Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Eccleſiaſtical Anointing, they have perform'd all God's Commandments, ſhould be advanced to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to receive the Reward of all their Labours. Seeing then theſe are the Things by which our Faith is manifeſted, let us ſee who it is that ſo keeps theſe ſacred Treaſures of his Faith, that he may be call'd truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100854:42"/>
For, as I ſaid before, he who do's not keep what is committed to his Truſt, is unfaithful.<note place="margin">How few or none are faithful towards God.</note> And truly, I do not enquire whether he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all things commanded in the Old and New Teſtaments; I will paſs by the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Old Law, all the Threatnings of the Prophets; and, which yet cannot be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs'd by, the ſeverer Diſcipline Part of the Apoſtles Books, and the Goſpel Doctrines of Perfection: I only deſire to know who it is obeys, even a very few of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither do I mean thoſe which many deny ſo far, as even to deteſt them: For ſuch is the Reſpect and Honour we now a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>days pay to God, that what parts of Devotion we think not fit to practiſe our ſelves, we hate to ſee in others. For who can now endure to hear that Saying of our Saviour, which bids us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>take no thought for the Morrow?</hi> Who takes<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.</note> bare-foot, or indeed, who is there cares to hear it? And therefore I paſs by all theſe. For the Faith in which we have all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence fails in this, that we eſteem thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts needleſs and ſuperfluous, which God has ordered as Neceſſary to Salvation. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. 5. v. 44. Luk. 6. v.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that hate you, and pray for them which deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> Where is there any one does all this, nay who is there who will vouchſafe, not to pray, but even to ſay ſo much for his Enemies as God commands us here? If any one go ſo far as to force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100854:42"/>
to do it; 'tis only Lip-labour, the Mind knows nothing of it: the Words, it may be, are pronounced, the Paſſions ſtill remain; and if the Enemy be nam'd againſt the Grain at Prayer, the Party only ſpeaks but never prays. 'Twill be tedious to mention all, however, I will add ſomewhat more, that we may ſee that we do not only not obey all God's Precepts, but that we perform very few or none of them. And therefore the Apoſtle cries, <hi>If any man think himſelf to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf.</hi> For this we make an addition to all our Crimes, that we take our ſelves to be Righteous and very Saints, tho' we offend in every thing, and ſo we go on heaping Iniquity upon Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>What Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is. 1 John. 3. v.</hi> 15.</note> upon this Preſumption of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Whoſoever hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Brother is a Murderer.</hi> From hence we may conclude there are many Murderers, who take themſelves to be very Innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find here that Murder may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as well in the Hater's Heart as by his Hand: which made our Saviour enforce that Commandment with a greater Penalty, when he ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his Brother</hi>

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only Hatred, but even Anger makes us in Danger of the Judgment, we plainly perceive that, as no one is altogether free from Anger and Paſſion, ſo no one is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100854:43"/>
free from Guilt. But our Lord proſecutes, as it were, the very Fibres of this Precept, and cuts each Bough and Branch of it. Says he, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou Fool, ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Hellfire: whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his Brother, Racha, ſhall be in danger of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi> There are many who do not know what ſort of Abuſe is contain'd under the Word <hi>Racha,</hi> who yet are very ſenſible of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front they receive when they are call'd <hi>Fools:</hi> And therefore in this Caſe, Men making uſe of their Knowledge rather than their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, had rather that their Guilt for the Abuſe they do know, ſhould be expiated by Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, than by the Councel of Man, for that they do not know.</p>

Seeing then that Matters are thus, and<note place="margin">What it is to imitate Chriſt.</note> that what is commanded by God is not only not done by us, but rather the quite contrary, When ſhall we perform thoſe greater Duties?

For even they who ſeem to renounce all Riches, do not renounce them ſo far as wholly to have abandon'd them. And they who are thought to bear the Croſs, do ſo bear it, that under pretence of that they

gain múch more Honour; than they do of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by the ſuffering for it. And yet all of theſe, altho' they did in reality perform ſomewhat of this, yet doubtleſs none of them could carry it ſo high by that way of Living, that they could go as upright as our Saviour went. For the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, ought himſelf alſo to walk even as he walked.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. But perhaps ſome will be apt to think that the Apoſtle's Commands are ſevere. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they might well be reckon'd ſuch, if they demanded greater Strictneſs of Duty than they perform'd themſelves. But if it does appear that they commanded others much leſs than they did themſelves, they will ſhew themſelves to have been not only not hard Maſters, but to be eſteem'd as moſt indulgent Parents, who, out of real Zeal to Religion, laid thoſe very Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on their own Shoulders, which, out of Tenderneſs to their Children they took off from their Backs.

And that he did really follow Chriſt, no one can doubt: Chriſt for our ſakes ſubjected himſelf to the World, and he himſelf for Chriſt's: Chriſt for our ſakes underwent Wearineſs and Pains, he did the ſame for Chriſt's: Chriſt ſuffered
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100854:44"/>
Scorn and Reproof for us, and he for Chriſt. Chriſt bore his Paſſion and his Death for us, he did the ſame for Chriſt. And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of his own good Actions and Deſerts, he had Reaſon to ſay, <hi>I have fought</hi>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100854:44"/>V. But ſome one may urge here, that the Times are quite alter'd, it is not expected now that we ſhould undergo for Chriſt's ſake what the Apoſtles then ſuffer'd. That's very true: For the Governours are not now Pagan, nor perſecuting Tyrants; the Blood of the Saints is not now powr'd forth, nor is our Faith try'd by Torture. Our God is content that our Eaſe and Quiet ſhould tend to his Service, that we ſhould make our ſelves acceptable now by the Purity and Innocence of our Actions, and by the unſpotted holineſs of our Lives. Our Faith and Devotion are ſo much the more indebted to him, by how much he has given us greater Bleſſings, and requires leſs Service. And therefore ſince Princes are now become Chriſtian, and there is no ſuch thing as Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and that Religion is not diſturb'd, we, who are not compell'd by more ſevere Tryals, ought at leaſt to pleaſe God by all manner of leſſer Duties. And 'tis odds, but that he, who readily diſcharges theſe leſſer Duties, would chearfully perform the greater, when call'd upon.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. We will therefore at preſent, paſs over the Sufferings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the other Severities which we find in Eccleſiaſtical Story, almoſt all the Chriſtians of thoſe Times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, who aſcended to Heavens Gates by the Staircaſe of their own Torments, and made Scaling Ladders of their Racks and Scaffolds. Let us ſee if in thoſe Services of Religion, which being leſs and more common, all we Chriſtians may at all times, in the greateſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100854:45"/>
perform, we do endeavour to anſwer our Lord's Commands. Chriſt commands us<note place="margin">Of Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suits to be avoided: and how God is to be obeyed in all things.</note> that we ſhould not be litigious, but who obeys him? Nay, he does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only command it, but he preſſes it ſo far, that he orders us to quit our Pretenſions to whatſoever is the Subject of the Conteſt, that ſo we may be freed from the Suit. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will ſue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. 5. v.</hi> 40.</note> 
                  <hi>thy Cloak alſo.</hi> I deſire to know, were there are any ſuch to be found, who will comply thus with an oppreſſing Adverſary, or rather, who they are who would not, were it in their Power, oppreſs their Adverſary themſelves? So far are we from quitting our other Garments with our Coats, that, if by any means we could tell how, we would take away our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's Coat and Cloak alſo. For we obey the Commands of our Lord ſo very religiouſly, that it is not enough for us, not to part with the leaſt part of our Garments to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, unleſs to the utmoſt of our Power, if we have opportunity, we tear All from him. To this our Lord has joyn'd another like and parallel Command: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 39.</note>

                  <note place="margin">How few or none O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey as they ought to do</note> How many do we think that do with Decency afford an Ear to this Command, or if they ſeem to do it; that do in heart believe it? Or how many rather, if they receive one Stroke, but will return an Hundred? So far are we from turning our Cheek to him that ſmites us, that then we think we get the better, not when we have maſter'd our adverſary by his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100854:45"/>
beating us, but by our mawling him. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>

                  <hi>ye would</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> We are ſo well acquainted with one part of this Sentence, that we never paſs it over; but the other we take as little Notice of, as if we knew nothing of it: For we know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well how we would have other Men deal by us, but are as ignorant as may be of our Duty to other Men. And I would to God we were really ignorant, for then our Guilt would be much the leſs, according to that Scripture; <hi>He that knew not his Maſter's will ſhall be beaten with few Stripes; but he that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>knew and did it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> However, this is a great Aggravation of the Offence, that we ſhould pick and chuſe one part of a Sentence of Scripture that makes for our Advantage, and neglect the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part in contempt of the Almighty. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does likewiſe by his Preaching, enforce this Command of God; <hi>Let no man ſeek his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. 10. v.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>own, but every man another's Wealth.</hi> And again, <hi>Look not every man on his own Things,</hi>

                  <hi>but every man alſo on the Things of others.</hi> You ſee here how ſincerely he executed this Command of Chriſt; for whereas our Saviour commands us to be as ſolicitous for other Men's Welfare as our own, he adviſes us to take more Care of other's Conveniences than our own, like the good Servant of a good Lord, and the excellent follower of ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Maſter, who treading in the very foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of his Lord, has, in ſome ſort, made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100854:46"/>
thoſe Footſteps of his Maſter more plain and open. Which of the Two now do we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians perform, what Chriſt commands, or what his Apoſtle? Truly, I think neither. For ſo far are we from doing any thing to forward the Convenience of other Men with ſome Loſs to our ſelves; that all of us bend all our Thoughts how to advantage our ſelves as much as may be at the Expence of other Men.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But, it may be, it will be ſaid in this place, that I have pick'd out ſome of the moſt difficult of God's Commands, which no body fulfils; and, as they think, which 'tis not poſſible that any body ſhould, and that I have omitted others which they could obſerve, and which are eaſie to be obſerv'd by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Pray let this be conſider'd in the firſt place, that it is not fitting for any Servant whatever of his own Head, to pick and chuſe out of his Maſter's Orders, what he likes, and what he diſlikes, and then inſolently to take what pleaſes him, and to refuſe what he do's not like: Eſpecially when the Maſters of this World don't think it a thing fit to be born with, that any Servants of theirs ſhould obey part of their Commands, and ſlight the reſt; and according to their Humours, ſhall do, forſooth, what they think fitting to be done, and ſhall ſpurn the reſt. For if Servants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Maſters only ſo far as pleaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there is no Duty paid to the Maſter by ſuch Obedience: For when a Servant only performs that part of his Maſter's Commands which he has a mind to, he do's not fulfil
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100854:46"/>
his Maſter's Pleaſure but his own. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we who are poor, ſilly, weak, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Mortals, cannot bear to be thus ſlighted by our own Servants, whom only the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Service makes inferior to us, ſince they are made of the ſame Mould with our ſelves: how unjuſtly do we deſpiſe the Great God of Heaven, who being but meer Men, think it not fit to be deſpiſed by Creatures of our own Condition! Unleſs, it may be, we are Men of that depth of Thought and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that, tho' we think it not convenient to take Affronts at our Servant's hands, yet we ſhould be very willing to have the Almighty ſubject to all the Abuſes that may be; and thoſe very Things which we think not fit to be tolerated by our ſelves, we judge very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that God ſhould bear from us. But to return; If there be any by this time, who think I have been ſpeaking all this while of the harder Commandments of God, and have ſaid nothing of the more eaſie ones, their Complaint is an idle one. To what purpoſe is it to talk of a Preference in Duties, where all are equally to be obſerv'd? For, as I ſaid before, as it is not at all fitting for the Servants of the meaneſt Mortal to chooſe out of their Maſter's Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what they would have done, and what left undone; ſo we who are the Servants of our Lord, ought to think it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unlawful to take only thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands at our own good liking, which pleaſe us, and to tread under feet with Pride and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence what we do not reliſh.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100854:47"/>VIII. However, let us ſubmit to thoſe, who, it may be, will not have us therefore mention the greater of our Lord's Commands, becauſe they fancy they fulfil the leſſer: not that it is ſufficient to Salvation to obſerve the Smaller and neglect the Greater, according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>James 2. v.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>whole Law, and yet offend in one Point he is guilty of all:</hi> And altho' it appears by this, that it is not ſufficient for us to perform the leſſer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, yet I agree to call them leſſer Commands, that I may ſhew that the greateſt part of Chriſtians do not obſerve, even thoſe which are the leaſt part of their Duty. Our Saviour commands that Chriſtian Men <hi>ſhould</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. 5. v.</hi> 34.</note> 
                  <hi>not Swear:</hi> But you ſhall find more of thoſe who forſwear themſelves, than of thoſe who do not ſwear at all. He commands like wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no body ſhould Curfe, and yet our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Talk is made up of Curſes. The firſt Dart we throw in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paſſion are Curſes, and what we are too weak to execute, we give our Paſſions leave to Wiſh: And thus in every diſcompoſure of our Minds, we uſe theſe Imprecations inſtead of Arms. So that every one plainly ſhews, that were it in his Power, he would do all the Miſchief which he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſhes to his Adverſary. And be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe all of us who do not obey the Divine Commands, eaſily get a Habit of this wicked way of Speaking, we are therefore apt to think that it will as eaſily take place with God who gave us thoſe Commands: But the Scripture ſays: <hi>Revilers and Evil-ſpeakers ſhall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100854:47"/>
not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And hence<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ. 5. v 5. 1 Cor. 6. v.</hi> 10.</note> we may perceive how heinous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive this ſort of Evil-ſpeaking is, ſeeing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we do many other good Actions, yet this alone will ſhut us out of Heaven. Chriſt commands us to forbear all Malice, and yet we envy not only Strangers but our very Neighbours: 'Tis not our Enemies alone we hate maliciouſly, but our very Friends; ſo much is this Evil riveted in all our Natures: our Hunger may be ſatisfied, but this detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Humour never can: We are always cloy'd with Meat, but never with Detraction. But, it may be, this is a Peccadillo not worth God's Notice: However the holy Scripture ſays, <hi>The Backbiter ſhall be rooted out:</hi> A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 1. v.</hi> 30.</note> and dreadful Sentence, and yet it cauſes no Amendment; for ſo long as one Man ſtill perſiſts to tear another, 'tis ſo great Pleaſure to him, that he do's even ſacrifice himſelf; and a juſt Return it is of ſuch a Miſchief, that it perſecutes its Author only, for in compariſon it hurts him not at all at whom 'tis levell'd, but racks and tears the Heart of him who vends it. But perhaps they'll think I doat in urging things thus, and I, for my part, can be content to be accounted a Doatard; but did our Bleſſed Lord himſelf doat, when he gave Commandment by his Apoſtle, <hi>That all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ. 4. v.</hi> 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Clamour and Evil-ſpeaking be put away with all Malice.</hi> Both theſe lodge with us perpetually, and yet I think we have more of Malice than of Clamour. For Clamour is not always in our Mouths, but Malice always in our Hearts;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100854:48"/>
and for that Reaſon, I believe, that when the Power of Clamouring has left us, yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice will remain. Our Lord has likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">Phil. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note> us to be without Murmuring and Complaining; But when were Mankind ever without them? If it be parching Heat, we complain of Drought; if a rainy Seaſon, then of Drowning: If the Year chance not to be over fruitful, then we accuſe its Barrenneſs, if it be plentiful, then the Cheapneſs of Things diſguſts us: We deſire to get Abundance, and when we have it, then we blame it. What can be more wicked and reproachful than ſuch Dealing? To fall out with God's Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſends us what we pray'd for. God hath commanded his Servants to avoid all manner of Offence, even that of the Eyes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>28.</note> And therefore he ſays, <hi>Whoſoever looketh on a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her in his Heart.</hi> By this we may plainly underſtand how chaſte our Saviour would have us be, who hath deny'd us the Liberty of a looſe wandring Look: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowing that the Lights of the Eyes are a ſort of Windows to our Hearts, and that all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſires enter us thro' the Eyes as thro' the natural paſſage; he would altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them whilſt without us, leſt when they are entred, they ſhould take firm Root in our Hearts, having firſt budded at the Eye: And therefore our Lord warns us, that the Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous Looks of lewd Men are not free from the Guilt of Adultery; ſo that they who would ſincerely guard themſelves from that Sin, ſhould
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100854:48"/>
put a watch upon their Looks. Our Saviour would likewiſe have all his Followers to have unſpotted Holineſs, and therefore commands them to avoid the leaſt thing that has but a Tendency to Sin: That a Chriſtian's Life ſhould be as clean as the cleareſt part of the brighteſt Eye; and as the Eye without Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Sight, cannot endure the ſmalleſt Duſt within it, ſo a Chriſtian's Life ſhould not have the moſt dimunitive Spot of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. And that is the Meaning of this following Saying of our Lords: <hi>If thine eye</hi>

               <p n="9">IX. Seeing then our Lord has requir'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in all theſe Particulars which I have nam'd: Where are they to be found, who

have perform'd them all, or even the ſmalleſt Part? Where are they who either love their Enemies, or do good to their Perſecutors, or that overcome Evil with Good; who turn their Cheek to him that ſmites them, or that yield up their Goods without Diſpute to them that take them? Who is there that avoids all baſe Detraction, who injures no one by baſe Words, who rather hold their Tongues, than break forth into bitter Railings? Who is there minds theſe leſſer Duties, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now the Greater ſpoken of before? Since then Matters are thus, and that we obey none of our Lord's Commands, what Reaſon have we to complain of God, when he ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to complain of us? Why ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine that God do's not hear us, when we our ſelves refuſe to hear Him, and whiſper abroad that God do's not at all look upon the World, when we refuſe to look up to Heaven? Why ſhould it trouble us that our Lord deſpiſes our Prayers, when we take care to deſpiſe his Precepts? Suppoſe we were upon the Level with our Lord: What room could there be for Complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he deals by us as we uſe Him? Which yet I could prove to be quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and that God deals more tenderly by us, than we do dutifully by Him. But to go on with the Parallel I began: And as our Lord ſays, <hi>I have called to you and you have not heard me,</hi>

by Him. I deſire to know where that mortal Maſter is, who would be content to manage Matters at this rate with his Servants, that in Return for Contempt receiv'd from his own Vaſſals, he ſhould only have the Pleaſure of ſlighting them again? But we do not only affront and contemn our God as Servants do their worldly Maſters, whoſe greateſt Slight is not to do what they are order'd: For we not only do not what we are order'd, but with all our Might and Main the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Thus God commands us to love one another; but we tear and hawl each other to pieces. God commands all to diſtribute their own Goods to thoſe that want them, and All invade the Properties of other Men. God commands that every Chriſtian ſhould have chaſte Eyes; but how few are there who do not wallow in the Filth of Fornication! But to what purpoſe ſhould I produce more? What I am now going to ſay is ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable: The Church of God it ſelf, which at all times ſhould be the Appeaſer and Peace-Maker, is now become the Grand Provoker and Exaſperator of God; For, bating a very few who have eſcaped the Contagion, what is every Congregation of Chriſtians but a Common-ſhore of Vices? For who will you find in the Church that is not either a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or a Glutton, Adulterer or Fornicator, Extortioner or Rioter, a Thief or Murderer? And what is worſe than all this, there is no end of them. For I appeal to the Conſcience of every Chriſtian; of all the Villainies and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100854:50"/>
Wickedneſſes I have nam'd, where is the Man that is not guilty of ſome, or rather of all of them? 'Tis eaſier to find one thro'-pac'd in all, than one who has nothing of them. But ſome perhaps may think the Cenſure here too hard, becauſe I ſay, <hi>who has nothing;</hi> And therefore I had much rather ſay, you may ſooner find them guilty of all theſe Crimes, than not of all; eaſier of the greater Sins, than of the leſs: That is, you'll eaſier find ſuch who would commit the greater Crimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the leſs, than ſuch as would act the leſſer ones without the greater. Our Congregations are fallen into ſuch a Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and Baſeneſs of Manners, that among Chriſtian People now, 'tis a piece of Religion and Sanctity to be leſs wicked than their Neighbours. So that ſome have leſs Reſpect for the Churches, or rather Temples and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of the moſt High God, than they have for the Houſe of ſome Petty Corporation-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. For tho' all Perſons don't preſume to crowd promiſcuouſly into the Gates of Princes, nor even of the Chief Governours or Officers, unleſs invited or cited by them as Judges, or to ſolicite Buſineſs, or elſe whoſe Station and Poſt do's permit it; ſo that if any enter inſolently, he's either beaten or driven back, is laugh'd at and expos'd, or has ſome other Mark of Diſreſpect put upon him: yet into the Temples, or rather the Altars and Sacred Places of our God, the moſt Sordid and Flagitious, ruſh on Heaps, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or Reverence; not that they ought not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100854:50"/>
to haſte thither to pray to God; but he that enters with the Deſign to endeavour to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe Almighty God, ought to be careful not to exaſperate him at going out: For they are quite two Things, to ask Forgiveneſs, and to provoke to Wrath. But is it not monſtrous and prodigious, that Men ſhould every hour commit the Things, the doing of which they every hour lament? They who enter the Church to Bemoan their former Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, what do I ſay, depart; nay even in the midſt of all their Prayers and Supplications, contrive to act the ſame! The Mouth ſays one thing and the Heart another; and whilſt in Word they Moan their paſt Tranſgreſſions, their Thoughts are ruminating upon new; ſo that their Prayer do's rather encreaſe their Guilt than prevail for Pardon; ſo that the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Curſe is verified in them, that their<note place="margin">Pſal. 109. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> own Words condemn them, and <hi>that their Prayers are turned into Sin.</hi> Laſtly, if any one would know what theſe Men think of in the Church, let him obſerve what follows. As ſoon as e're the Publick Service ends, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one haſtens to follow his old Trade; ſome to Steal, ſome to be Drunk; ſome to Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome to the High-pad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that 'tis plain they thought on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe the time they ſpent in Church, in order to their after Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100854:51"/>
but nothing that bears the Face of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can ever be ſo wicked? Pray what is the Merchant's Life but Perjury and Cheat? The Courtiers but Iniquity? The Lawyers Calumny, and the Soldiers Plunder? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you think theſe Things are tolerable in ſuch Men as theſe: their Actions, you'll ſay, are ſuitable to their Profeſſion, ſo that it is no Wonder to ſee them act according to what they profeſs. As if God Almighty were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Men ſhould either act or profeſs Wickedneſs; or that the Divine Majeſty were not at all offended, when ordinary Perſons commit the greateſt Sin; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that upon a Poll they are far the greater Part of all Mankind: and certainly where there is the greateſt Multitude of Sinners, there Heaven is moſt offended. But perhaps, you'll ſay, all the Nobility are free from ſuch Wickedneſs. That cannot be; for Nobility all over the World is nothing elſe but one Great Man above a great many mean Ones. However, let us ſee whether they are Fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or no: And in the firſt place, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Scripture ſays of Men of this Rank.

                  <hi>not rich men oppreſs you, do not they blaſpheme that Worthy Name, by the which ye are call'd?</hi> This is a heavy Teſtimony of the Apoſtles:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100854:51"/>
unleſs it may be, Noblemen may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not concern'd in it, becauſe the <hi>Rich</hi> are only nam'd in it. However either the rich Men here nam'd are the ſame as Noblemen, or if there be any very Rich who are not Noble, 'tis as good as if they were ennobled; for ſuch is the Baſeneſs of this Age, that no body is eſteem'd ſo Noble as they who are very rich. But whether the Apoſtle ſpeaks of either or both, may be eaſily compounded; for it matters not which part is here chiefly meant, ſince what is ſaid agrees very well to either. For where is there ſo much as one Nobleman or Rich man, who abhors theſe Crimes? And yet in this I may be miſtaken: for there are many abhor them, but few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> avoid them: They abhor in others what they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace themſelves, being after a Wonderful manner, both Accuſers and Advocates of the ſame Crimes. In publick they deteſt what they act in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecret: and ſo by ſuch Practice, while they think they condemn others, they rather involve themſelves in their own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But let us leave thoſe who are moſt guilty: and ſee if we can find that Rich or Noble perſon who is really innocent, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his Hands from all manner of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; tho' I think I have added thoſe words <hi>all manner of</hi> very impertinently: I wiſh there be any who abſtain from the greateſt; becauſe it may be Great Perſons take it as a part of their Priviledge, that they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leſſer Crimes, and therefore I ſhall ſay nothing of the leſſer Sins.

if any of them are free from thoſe two Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ones of Murder and Whoredom: Which of them does not reek in Humane Blood, and wallow in filthy Lewdneſs?

I commend you for not doing them, but it may be you have formerly done them; and to leave off doing them is not altogether equivalent to the never having done them. But ſuppoſe it be ſo, where's the Advantage by it, that one Man leaves off to ſin, and Many continue in it? One Man's Repentance will not heal the Crimes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; nor is it ſufficient to appeaſe God's Wrath, that one forſakes his Sins, ſince All in general have offended Him: Eſpecially, when he who is converted, that he may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape Eternal Death, will receive great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by ſuch Converſion, if he do eſcape it; but yet it ne're can come to paſs that he ſhould free others from the Pains of Damnation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be the moſt intolerable Pride, and a Crime of a Monſtrous Complexion, if any one ſhould take himſelf to be ſo Good, as to think that wicked Men thro' him might be ſaved.

body has Impudence enough to compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Great Men as theſe: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' a Man at preſent endeavours to pleaſe God, yet it is a kind of the greateſt Injuſtice, if he preſumes upon his own Righteouſneſs, and by this is taken away all hopes of that falſe Opinion by which we believe that a Multitude of wicked Men may be defended from all preſent Evils by the Prayers of a few good ones. For ſeeing that no one can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to equal thoſe I have nam'd above, what hope can any have, that Men that are foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, many in Number, and very Wicked, ſhould be deliver'd by the Prayers of a very few good Ones: when thoſe holy Men, ſo familiar with God Himſelf, could not obtain this of our Lord, that in their Children they might ſave their own Fleſh and Blood: and Juſtly: For, altho' all Children in General may ſeem to be Parts and Members of their Parents, yet theſe are not to be eſteem'd Parts of them, who have ſever'd themſelves from them by contrary Affections, and in ſuch the Benefit of Nature and Relation is loſt by the Degeneracy of their Manners. And by the ſame Reaſon it is, that we, who call our ſelves Chriſtians, loſe all the Benefit of ſo Great a Name by the Naughtineſs of our Converſations. It does not all advantage us to have a holy Name without good Manners; for a Life diſagreeable to the Profeſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroys the Honour of the Illuſtrious Title, by the Baſeneſs of unſeemly Actions. Since then

there are ſcarce any Party of Chriſtians, any Corner of the Churches to be found, that do not abound with all Sorts of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Contagion of deadly Sins, what Reaſon have we to flatter our ſelves for being known by the Name of Chriſtians? Seeing by being called by that moſt Sacred Name, we enhance our Guilt, becauſe our Lives diſgrace the Title. And ſo under the Name of Religion, we offend God the more, being under all the Ties and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</p>

For ſeeing, as I have often ſaid, That the Faith of a Chriſtian conſiſts in this, that he ſincerely obſerve the Commandments
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100854:54"/>
of Chriſt: It is manifeſt, beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that he who is inſincere in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular has not Faith; and that he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns Chriſt's Commandments, do's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt: and ſo the Whole of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turns on this, that he who does not the Duties of the Chriſtian Religion, cannot be thought to be a Chriſtian. For the bare Name without Action and Duty, ſignifies nothing. For as a certain Author ſays: What is Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salvian</hi> in his 2 Book to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> without the height of Merit, but a Title of Honour without a Man? Or what is Dignity in an unworthy Perſon, but Pearl on a Dunghill? And therefore, that I may uſe the ſame Expreſſions, What is a holy Name without Merit, but Pearl on a Dunghill.

               <p>But whoever has a mind to be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that Words are of little Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Things, let him reflect what Numbers of People have loſt even their Names, when they fail'd in their Merits. The twelve Tribes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were antiently cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by God Himſelf, had two holy Names given them, for they were call'd, <hi>The People of God,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For thus we read, <hi>Hear,</hi>

               <p>And really, we give ſufficient Occaſion for any one to think thus of us: For we all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Sin with ſuch an Univerſal Conſent, as tho' upon mature Advice, we had entred into a Confederacy of Sinning.

When the Holy

Ghoſt tells us, that Faith it ſelf without works, will not profit a Chriſtian; and certainly 'tis much more to have Faith, than a bare Name; for the Name is only the diſtinction of the Man, but Faith is the fruit of the Mind: And yet the Apoſtle teſtifies, that even this Fruit of Faith, unleſs accompany'd by Good-works, will prove unfruitful, where he ſays, <hi>Faith without good works is dead.</hi> And again. <hi>For</hi>

but rather profit by it: <hi>Thou doeſt believe,</hi> (ſays this Scripture to the Chriſtian) <hi>that there is One God, thou doeſt well: The Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> Was the Apoſtle here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Miſtake, when he compares the Faith of a Chriſtian Man to that of a Devil? Not at all, but deſigning to explain what he had ſaid before, that without good Works, a Chriſtian ought to arrogate nothing to himſelf on Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Faith; he therefore adds, The Devils believe there is a God; and that as thoſe Devils, altho' they do ſo believe, yet ſtill continue in their Perverſneſs, ſo ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had juſt ſuch Faith as this of the Devils, would frankly own the Belief of a God, but ſtill perſiſt in their evil Doings. And then, to the Shame and Condemnation of wicked Sinners, he ſubjoyns, that the Devils did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not only the Name of God, but did fear and tremble: As much as if he had ſaid, Why do you, O Man, whoever you are, flatter your ſelf in your Belief, which without the Fear and Obedience of God ſignifies nothing? The very Devils themſelves have more than this. For you have only one Thing, they have Two; you have a Belief, but have not Fear; they have both Belief and Fear. Why do you wonder then if we are puniſh'd, or think it ſtrange we are chaſtis'd, if given into our Enemies hands, if we are leſs Powerful than other Men? For all our Miſeries, Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, Overthrows, Captivities, and even our baſeſt Slavery are Manifeſtations of a bad Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and of a good Lord. How I pray you,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100854:56"/>
are they Teſtimonies of a bad Servant? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I only ſuffer a ſmall part of what I deſerve. And how are they of a good Lord? Becauſe by that he ſhews what it is we deſerve, altho' in Mercy he does not inflict it on us: for he had rather correct us with the moſt mild and gentle Chaſtiſements, than that we ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; ſhould our Puniſhment be adequate to our Crimes, Death it ſelf would be our Doom: But He being infinitely more Merciful than Severe, had rather by a gentle Cenſure reform us, than by the Stroke of a juſt Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſtroy us. I am very well ſatisfied that it is not at all pleaſing to us to be thus puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But can it ſeem ſtrange to us that God ſhould puniſh us for our Sins, when we every day beat our Servants for their Faults? We are partial and unjuſt Judges: We would not have ſuch a contemptible Creature as Man chaſtis'd by God, when yet we chaſtiſe Man, a Creature, in the ſame Rank with our ſelves. But I do not admire to ſee us ſo unreaſonable in this Matter; ſince our very Nature and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities are altogether thoſe of Slaves: We would commit Faults, but would not be beaten for them. We have every one of us the Temper of our meaneſt Slaves, we would all Sin without Puniſhment. I appeal to all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am miſtaken or no. For I do aver that there is not one to be found, let his Crime be never ſo Great, who will freely own that he ought to ſuffer for it. And hence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how unrighteouſly and wickedly we are moſt Severe upon others, when we are indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100854:56"/>
to our ſelves, rigorous to them, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our own Skins. For the ſelf ſame Fault we chaſtiſe others, but abſolve our ſelves. This is both intolerable Inſolence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption! We will not acknowledge any Guilt in our ſelves, and yet we have the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to exerciſe Authority upon others for the ſame thing. Can any thing poſſibly be more unjuſt and perverſe than we are in this Thing? We eſteem that Wickedneſs to be very tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in our ſelves, which we puniſh in others without Mercy. And therefore the Apoſtle has very good Reaſon to ſpeak to us after this manner: <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 2. v.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doeſt the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But me thinks, I hear ſome of the rich<note place="margin">Of Theſe wherein it is excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and of Servants Faults.</note> ones ſaying, we are not guilty of the ſame Faults as our Slaves: for ſome of them are Thieves, and over-run their Maſters; ſome of them mind nothing but their Guts and Bellies. 'Tis very true that theſe are the common Faults of Servants; but yet their Maſters have more and much greater than theſe; tho' I can't ſay ſo of all Maſters; for ſome are to be excepted, altho' they are but very few: whom I forbear to name at preſent, leſt I may be thought not ſo much to commend them by ſuch naming, as to expoſe the others, whom I ſhall be forc'd to omit. In the firſt place then, if Servants are Thieves, it may be they are compell'd to it out of meer Neceſſity: who
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100854:57"/>
altho' they receive their uſual Wages, yet it may be, the cuſtomary Stipend may not be ſufficient, and tho' it compleat their Wages, yet it may not fill their Bellies; and ſo for that Reaſon their Want may make it leſs Culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for he ſeems to commit a kind of excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Theſt, who is forc'd againſt his Will to the Fact. And the holy Scripture ſeems in ſome fort, almoſt to excuſe the Fault of ſuch poor diſtreſſed Creatures, when it ſays; <hi>Men, do not deſpiſe a Thief, if he ſteal to ſatisfie his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Soul when he is hungry.</hi> So ſays <hi>Solomon:</hi> he ſteals to ſatisfie his Soul; and therefore they ſhould not be too Severely blam'd by us, whom the ſacred Scripture ſeems thus to excuſe. What I have ſaid here of Servant's Thievery, may be likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid of their Running away, and I think, with much more Reaſon; for not only Want and Poverty, but too ſevere Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compels them to it. They are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Dread of their Bayly's, Superviſors, and Task-maſters; ſo that among ſuch a Gang, they ſeem to be rather any Bodies Servants than their Maſter's: Every one Beats them, every one Mawls them. And I need ſay no more, than that many Servants fly to their own Maſters, for Fear of their Fellow-Servants. So that their Running-away is not ſo much to be imputed to themſelves, as to thoſe that force them. Poor unfortunate Creatures, they are under the greateſt Violence; they deſire to ſtay and ſerve, and yet are compell'd to run away: They would not by any means depart from the Service of their Maſters, and yet
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100854:57"/>
the Cruelty of their Fellow-Servants will not ſuffer them quietly to undergo it. They are charg'd likewiſe to be guilty of Lying: when yet 'tis the Barbarity of the preſent Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that makes them do it; for they Lye purely to avoid the Laſh, and what Wonder is it that a frighted Servant ſhould tell a Lye to ſave a Scourging? They are further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Gluttony and Gormondiſing. This is no Rarity; For he that has felt the Force of Hunger oft, is more Eager to ſtuff himſelf. But granting that he do's not want ſufficient Food, 'tis certain that he Faſts from Dainties; and therefore he may be Pardon'd, if he Eagerly deſires to Taſte what always is kept from him. But now you Great and Rich Perſon, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with All manner of Plenty, and who for that Reaſon ought to Honour God by your good Works, becauſe you ſo Largely taſte of His Favours without ceaſing, let us ſee if your Actions are entirely perfect, or even ſo much as Innocent. And where are thoſe Great Men, as I ſaid before, bating a very few, that are not Tainted with all manner of Crimes? When I thus except a Few, I wiſh I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Greater Number; for the Innocence of very Many might tend to the Preſervation of All. I would not be underſtood to ſpeak in this place of any other than of ſuch a One, who knows that what I ſay is within himſelf. For if what I am now mentioning be not within his own Conſcience, the Whole of what I urge do's him no Hurt at all; but if he be conſcious to himſelf of what I ſay, let him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100854:58"/>
reckon it to come from his own Conſcience, and not from my Tongue. And in the firſt place, that I may ſpeak of Servant's Faults; If thy Servant be a Run-away, thou Rich and Great Man art a Run-away likewiſe. For all they Run away from the Lord, who relinquiſh the Law of the Lord. VVhat then is it that you with all your Riches, blame in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? VVhy, he runs away from his Lord and Maſter, and you from yours. But in this you are much more Faulty than he, becauſe 'tis ten to one but that he deſerts a bad Maſter, but you always a good One. In the next place, you blame the Voraciouſneſs of your Servant. That which his Poverty will very rarely admit him to be guilty of, your Plenty makes your daily Practice. You ſee therefore that you, and only you are the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more eſpecially laſh'd by the Apoſtle's Judgment, becauſe in what you judge another, you condemn your ſelf: for you do the ſame Things which you Cenſure in others, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, but Greater and Much more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; you fail not to puniſh Intemperance in him tho' acted very rarely, when you your ſelf are daily Cramm'd, even to the very Throat. Theft, in your Opinion, is a Crime likewiſe peculiar in Servants. But you, with all your Goods, are guilty of Theft likewiſe, for all they who do things that are unlawful, do by that involve themſelves in the Guilt of Theft.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100854:58"/>IV. But what need I treat of theſe Matters<note place="margin">Of the World liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</note> with ſuch Nicety, and as at a diſtance, when not only the private Pilferings, but even the Notorious open Robberies of the wealthier ſort are Manifeſt to all the VVorld? VVhere is there one that lives near a Rich Man, who is not actually a Beggar, or in as bad a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? For by the Incroachments and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Men of Power, the weaker and meaner Sort loſe all that's theirs, and even their Perſons too together with their Goods: So that the ſacred Scripture does deſervedly ſpeak of both theſe ſorts of Men, when it ſays, <hi>As the wild Aſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Lions Prey in the</hi>

For what's the Advancement of a Grandee now, but the porſcribing of a City, or what's the Lieutenancy of others, whom I forbear to name, but Pillaging and Plunder? For nothing brings ſo certain a Deſtruction on the poorer Sort as Power. And Preferment is now purchas'd by ſome few, but to be paid by the deſtroying of All; Than which nothing can be more unworthy or unjuſt. The poor Subject pays the Price of the Preferment which he never purchas'd: and tho' the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain's made without him, yet he ſhall know the Payment: The VVorld's turn'd Topſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turvy for the Advancement of a Few; One Man's Grandeur is the Bane of the whole VVorld.

                  <hi>Gaul's</hi> are ſenſible how they have been Plunder'd, tho' not alike by all, and therefore they have ſome ſmall Strength left yet, in ſome few Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by reaſon that the Integrity and Honour of ſome few Governours, has ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd thoſe Provinces, which the Rapine of many others had waſted.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But I have digreſs'd too far our of pure Grief and Concern: To return therefore to what I was ſaying before: What Vice is there familiar to their Servants, in which the Great Ones are not equally concern'd? Unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they make this Difference, to puniſh that as a Fault in the Servant, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves commit, as Juſt and Lawful: Beſides, a Servant is not admitted to Aſpire ſo high, as to exerciſe thoſe Oppreſſions and Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have before charg'd on the Wealthier Sort: Altho' in that I may be miſtaken; For ſome, who from Servants have become Great, have done the ſame or greater Feats. But this ought not to be any Imputation upon Servants in General, that ſome from their Condition have been ſo far Advanc'd. Murders are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very rare among the Servants, out of the Dread and Fear of Death: but you hear of them every day among the richer Sort, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope of Pardon. Unleſs, it may be, I am thought to deal partially, to reckon this for a Fault which the Rich Men do: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when they kill ſome of their ordinary Servants, they think it is but Juſtice to do ſo,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100854:59"/>
and not at all a Crime. But this is not all, they make uſe of the ſame Liberty in all their Lewdneſs and Uncleanneſs. For I would fain ſee that Rich Man who obſerves the ſacred Tyes of Wedlock, whom the Frenzy of Luſt do's not hurle headlong, whoſe Houſe and Family are not a ſort of Stews, and who do's not gratifie his mad Deſires upon whatſoever Perſon the Fevor of his wicked Luſts directs him: according to what the holy Writ ſays of ſuch Sparks as theſe. <hi>They were as fed Horſes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem. 5. v.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Morning, every one Neighing after his Neighbour's Wife.</hi> For do's not he prove this to be directly ſaid of himſelf, who endeavours fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to enjoy whatſoever his Eyes luſt after? Perhaps I ſhall be thought to deal very hardly to mention any thing of their Concubines, becauſe that, in compariſon of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Wickedneſs, is a ſort of Chaſtity, it looks like being contented with few of the Sex, and to reſtrain their Luſts to a certain Number of Wives; Judge the Expreſſion of <hi>Wives:</hi> becauſe many are arriv'd to that height of Impudence, as to Eſteem their Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as their Wives; and I could wiſh, that as they are thought to be in a manner Wives, ſo that they were the only Ones. For it is much more foul and abominable, that ſome who have lighted upon Honourable Matches, do a ſecond time take Wives out of the Rank of Servants, thereby diſgracing the Honour of ſacred Wedlock, by the Meaneſs of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate an Allyance, not at all Bluſhing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Husbands of their own Servants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100854:60"/>
the State of their Noble Marriage in the dirty Beds of their own Slaves: Such Men I wiſh with all my Heart, in the Condition and State of thoſe their Spouſes, ſince they have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves ſo very fond of their Company.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. I doubt not but very many of thoſe who are really Great and Noble, or thoſe who would be thought ſo, do receive with Scorn and Contempt that, in the handling the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I am now about, I have ſaid that ſome Servants are far leſs Wicked than their Maſters. But ſince I have not ſpoken this of All, but only of ſuch are Really ſo, I ought not to incur the Anger of any one, unleſs he know himſelf to be Indeed ſuch as I have Reflected upon, leſt for that very Reaſon, he be thought to be One of that Gang. Whoever among the Nobility do really deteſt ſuch Enormities, ſhould much rather be diſpleas'd with thoſe, who by their Vile and Naughty Actions, diſgrace the Titles that they bear: For tho' ſuch are a Burden and Scaldal to all Chriſtians in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet the Stanch and Filth of their Actions, reflects moſt immediately upon that Order of which they are a Part. VVell then, 'tis grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I have ſaid, that ſome Noblemen are much more wicked than their Servants, I did ſay it, and it might ſeem odd enough, if I did not prove it as well as ſay it. Now to give an Inſtance of one of the Greateſt wickedneſſes, of which you ſhall ſcarce ever find any one Servant to have been guilty. For can any one Servant be nam'd that ever kept a Swarm of VVhores, or that is ſtain'd with the Scandal of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100854:60"/>
having many VVives; or, like a Dog or Boar, thinks he may have as many Miſtreſſes as his Luſt can Satisfie? I know the Anſwer to this is eaſie, That Servants cannot do theſe things; and that they would certainly do them, if it were in their Power. I believe it. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I cannot admit that as already done, which as yet I never ſaw done. For let their Minds be never ſo deprav'd, and their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never ſo wicked, yet no one ought to be puniſh'd for a Crime he never committed. That Servants are Baſe and Nought, is very certain. But then thoſe who are Noble and Better-bred, are much more to be blam'd, if being in a more Honourable Station, their Manners are much worſe. So that the Iſſue of this whole Affair will of neceſſity come to this, not that Servants ſhould be altogether quit from the Guilt of their Naughtineſs, but that many of the Great and Rich Men, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Servants, are much more to be blam'd. For who can ſufficiently ſet forth, as it ought to be, that vile Robbery, that when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was as good as dead, or at leaſt breathing its laſt Gaſp, that in that part in which it yet ſeem'd to live, it ſhould expire; being ſtrangl'd with Cords of Taxes, as much as by the hands of the Invaders, and yet in this Condition you ſhall find very many of the Poor, who bear the Taxes of the Rich? That is, you ſhall find very many Rich Men whoſe Taxes murder the Poor: But what do I talk of finding very many, I fear I might have ſaid with greater Truth, you may find them all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100854:61"/>
ſuch. For there are ſo very few free from this Evil, if there are any, that on that ſide where I ſay you may find Many, I might as well at once have included All. For what has the Eaſe ſome time ſince given, to ſome Cities produc'd, but only to ſet all the Rich Men free, and to encreaſe the Burden of the Poor, that the old Duties might be taken off from their Backs, and New ones put upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that the removal and taking off of ſome ſmall Services ſhould enrich the one, only to torment the other with the addition of ten times greater: that they might grow rich by leſſening a Charge that was but a Feather to them, only to preſs the other to Death with multiplying the Load already too heavy to be born: So that the Remedy with the greateſt Injuſtice relieves the Rich, and as unjuſtly murders the Poor, a moſt unrighteous Reward to the One, and as unrighteous a Ruine to the Other? VVhence we may obſerve, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more wicked than ſuch rich Men, who deſtroy the Poor by pretending to aſſiſt them, and nothing more unfortunate than ſuch mean Perſons, who are Ruin'd by that which was deſign'd as a Cure for all.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But what kind of dealing is this, and what ſort of Sanctity muſt we ſtile it, that if any of the Nobility offer to be converted to God, he preſently loſes the Advantage of his Honour? Or what ſort of Reſpect has Chriſt in that Chiſtian Country, where the very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his Religion makes the Party ignoble? For as ſoon as any one begins to amend
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100854:61"/>
and grow better, he is deſpis'd and contemn'd as one grown much worſe; ſo that, for that Reaſon, all are in a manner, forc'd to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that they may not grow cheap. And therefore it is not without Reaſon that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays, <hi>The whole World lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>John 5. v.</hi> 19</note> And very truly; for with good grounds may the whole be ſaid to lie in Wickedneſs, where is there no room for the Good. For the Whole is ſo full of all manner of Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that either they are all wicked who are in it, or thoſe few good that are remaining, are Haraſs'd and Perſecuted by the reſt. So that, as I ſaid, if any one of Note applies himſelf to Religion, he preſently loſes his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For when any one changes his Habit, he at the ſame time changes his Title; if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Valu'd, he is now Deſpiſable; if he was before very Splendid, he is now as Mean; if he was before all over Honour, he is now all over Contempt. And yet ſome Worldlings and People of little Faith, think it ſtrange that they feel the Anger of an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, when they thus perſecute God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Perſons of his Saints! All things are perverted and turn'd Topſy-turvy. If any one is righteous, he is deſpis'd as tho' he were wicked; if any one is wicked, he is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as tho' he were righteous. 'Tis no wonder therefore if we daily ſuffer worſe things, ſince we our ſelves grow worſe each day than other. For Mankind daily commit new Sins, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave the old ones. A new Crop of Vices ariſes as a daily Addition to the remaining old Stock.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100854:62"/>VIII. What room therefore is there for<note place="margin">How God by our Sins is daily provoked.</note> Complaint? Whatever Hardſhips and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences we ſuffer, they are much leſs than we deſerve! What reaſon have we to ſay that God deals hardly by us? Certainly we deal much more hardly with God. For we exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Him by our Impurities, and compell him to puniſh us againſt his Will. And altho' the Eſſence and Majeſty of God be of that Nature, that it is not to be diſturb'd by the Paſſion of Anger, yet we by our Iniquities do ſo mightily provoke him, that we even force Him to be angry. We do, as I may ſay, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence to His Goodneſs, and rudely lay hands on His Mercy. And when His loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs is ſuch that it would for ever ſpare us, the Sins we commit oblige Him to plague us with Misfortunes. And as they who beſet the moſt fenced Cities, or who endeavour to deſtroy or take the ſtrongeſt Forts, do without doubt ply them with all ſorts of Arms and Engines; ſo we in ſtorming the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, make uſe of all the greateſt Villanies and Crimes as our offenſive Arms; and eſteem Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God as injurious to us, when we our ſelves are moſt injurious to Him. For every Fault of every Chriſtian is an Affront offer'd to the Divine Majeſty: For when we do thoſe things which God forbids, we tread his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments under our Feet; and therefore it is very wickedly done of us to accuſe God of dealing Severely by us in our Calamities: we ſhould only blame our ſelves: For when we commit thoſe Faults which are the occaſion of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100854:62"/>
our Diſtreſſes, 'tis we our ſelves that are the Authors of our Misfortunes. Why then do we cry out of the Sharpneſs of our Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Every one of us is his own Tormentor, ſo that that of the Prophet is ſaid to all of us:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai. 50. v.</hi> 11.</note>

When he heaps one Sin upon the head of another. And when do's he enter into Everlaſting Fire? When by an overplus and ſuperfluity of daily Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he hath fulfill'd the remedileſs Summ Total of his Iniquities; as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid to the Great Men of the <hi>Jews, Fill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye up</hi>

So in the old Law when it makes mention, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were fulfill'd, it tells us, that the Angels ſpoke thus to <hi>Lot: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

The cuſtomary ways of Sinning are not ſufficient for many now: They are not contented with Brawlings, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Rapine, Drunkenneſs, Rioting, Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Perjury, Adulteries, Murders, no nor all

of them together, altho' moſt barbarouſly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane, yet in Fact moſt injuriouſly inflicted on many, unleſs in the height of their Fury, they lay their Blaſphemous hands even on God himſelf. For as the Scripture ſays of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. <hi>v. 9. v.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſet their mouth againſt the Heavens; and their tongue walketh thro' the Earth: And they ſay, how doth God know, and is there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the moſt High?</hi> And in another place.<note place="margin">Pſal. 94. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note>

For altho' no very wicked Action can be conſonant to right Reaſon, becauſe Reaſon and Sinning are inconſiſtent, yet in my Opinion there is no wickedneſs ſo very wild and unreaſonable as this. For what can ſavour more of Frenzy, than that a Man ſhould acknowledge God to be the Creator of all Things, and yet to deny that he governs them; that he is the Former and Maker of all Things, and yet that he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects his own Handywork?

Now on the contrary, I aſſert that he had ſo Great Care of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that I will prove, that he exercis'd it even before the Creation. The very Thing it ſelf ſhews it plainly. For he had never made any thing, unleſs he had ſome Thoughts of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100854:64"/>
for we do not ſee any part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſo very dull to undertake or go through with any thing that he may never mind it when he has done it. For he who cultivates his Field, do's it for that End, that he may preſerve it in that order. He who plants a Vineyard, do's it with Deſign to keep up the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He who begins to raiſe a Flock, do's it with Deſign to take care of their Increaſe. So he who builds a Houſe, or lays the Foundation of one, altho' at that time he has not a Dwelling ready for him, yet he undergo's the Charge and Pains of Building, in hopes and proſpect of his future Habitation. But why do I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this in Man, ſince even the ſmalleſt Inſects direct their Actions with the Inſtinct of what is to come! Thus the Ants in their ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Cells, lay up what various Fruits they can, and gather all their Stock in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Lives. So Bees, when they lay the Foundation for their Honey-Combs, or gather that which comes from the Flowers; to what end do they deſire the Thyme; but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and hope of Honey, or fly from Flower to flower, but out of love to their future young Ones? Hath God then, who hath implanted in the leaſt of Creatures ſuch Affections for their own works, depriv'd only himſelf of the love of his Creatures, eſpecially ſince all the Paſſion we have for good things deſcends to us from his good Love alone? For he is the Fountain and Original of All things; <hi>'tis in him,</hi> as the Scripture ſays, <hi>we live and move</hi>

that Affection with which we love every thing that is ours. For all the World and all Mankind are the Goods of their Creator: and therefore from that Affection with which he has made us love our Goods and Relations, he would have us underſtand how much it is that he loves his Goods and Relations.

But what do I ſay of a Father? Yea rather much more than that of a Father. For that Saying of our Saviour in the Goſpel proves it ſo. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that</hi>

                     <hi>John 3. v.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>he gave his onely begotten Son for the Life of the World.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi>

               <p n="10">X. This then is what I have ſaid before, that God loves us more than any Father does his Child. For 'tis a plain ſign that he loves us beyond the Love of Children, becauſe for our ſakes he ſpared not his own Son. And what's much more, a righteous Son, an onely begotten Son, and that Son God. Nay, and that which heightens it, 'twas for us, wicked, ungodly, moſt unrighteous us. Who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100854:65"/>
value this Love of God toward us, ſince God's Juſtice is ſo Great, that it is not capable of admitting the leaſt ſhadow of Injuſtice? For according to Humane Reaſon that Man would do a very unjuſtifiable Act, who ſhould cauſe a very good Son to be deſtroy'd for the ſake of very bad Servants. But in this the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love of God and his admirable Power is ſeen, that the Greatneſs of his Juſtice cannot be comprehended by Man, but rather in our weak Sight the greateſt Juſtice ſeems almoſt a ſort of Injuſtice. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that he might ſhew us the Immenſity of the Divine Mercy, ſays thus: <hi>For when we were</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly: for ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die.</hi> This one Sentence plainly ſhews us the great loving-kindneſs of God, for if it be hard to find one who will lay down his Life for the beſt Cauſe, Chriſt has demonſtrated the Mighty Work he did for us, when he died for our Iniquities. But in what follows, he gives us a Reaſon why our Lord did all this: <hi>God commendeth his love toward us, in that while</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us, much more then, being now juſtified by his Blood we</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall be ſaved from Wrath through him.</hi> He commendeth it in this that he died for Sinners. For the unworthineſs of the Party who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it, adds a greater Value to the Favour: and therefore he ſays; <hi>God commendeth his love toward us.</hi> How does he commend it? Becauſe he beſtow'd the Bleſſing on thoſe who did not deſerve it. For if he had given it to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100854:65"/>
holy and deſerving Men, he would not have ſeem'd to have beſtow'd a Favour he was no way oblig'd to, but rather to have diſcharg'd a Debt. What therefore do we give in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for theſe ſo Great Mercies, or rather what ought we in Duty to return? Why in the firſt place, that which the holy Prophet reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that he did owe, and was reſolv'd to pay, when he ſays: <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me, I will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. 116. v. 12. v.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> This then is the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that we ſhould give Death for death, all of us be ready to lay down our Lives for him, who ſo freely died for us, altho' our Deaths will be of infinitely leſs Value than His: So that if we ſhould ſuffer Death, we ſhall not by any means diſcharge the Debt. However, if we cannot pay the Whole, we ſhall ſeem in ſome ſort to do it, if we take care to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it as far as we can. This then, as I ſaid, is the firſt Return. Now the ſecond is, that if we cannot pay the Debt by Death, we ſhould pay it by Love. For ſo our Saviour himſelf, as the Apoſtle ſays, would recommend his Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to All, that by the Example of his Mighty Loving-kindneſs he might draw them to the exerciſe of mutual Love and Charity. And as it is reported of thoſe <note n="c" place="margin">Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones.</note> Gemms and Rarities of Nature, which being plac'd near to Iron, be it never ſo hard, will take it up with almoſt a kind of Affection; ſo he the pureſt and greateſt Gemm in the Coeleſtial Kingdoms deſign'd, that by his Deſcent from Heaven, he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100854:66"/>
might joyn himſelf nearer to us, tho' hard as any Steel, that ſo he might move us to his Affections, as it were, by the hands of his own Love; ſo that making Acknowledgment of his Gifts and Favours, we might underſtand what it was fitting for us to do for ſo good a Maſter, when he had done ſuch Mighty things for ſo bad Servants; and ſo that Saying of the Apoſtle might be fulfill'd: <hi>That for his</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. Seeing then, that we are indebted to our Lord in all theſe Particulars, let us ſee how well we pay him, and what Returns we make. Why all thoſe Vertues which I have named above, every thing that is Baſe and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, every thing that will affront God, ſuch as wicked Actions, debauch'd Morals, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Bloody-hands, filthy Luſts, greedy Deſires, and every Wickedneſs that may more eaſily be thought of than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. <hi>For it is a Shame,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ. 5. v.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>even to ſpeak of thoſe things, which are done of them in ſecret.</hi> But this is not all: For theſe things have been done formerly as well as now. But it is ſad and lamentable, that we add new Sins to the old ones, and not only new, but heatheniſh and monſtrous ones, and ſuch as were never heard of before in the Churches of God, venting prophane Speeches againſt God, and blaſphemous Slanders, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100854:66"/>
that God is regardleſs, ſupine, negligent, and not at all governing the World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mercileſs and untrue to his Promiſes, inhumane, hard, and cruel. For he who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs, negligent and careleſs, how can he be thought to be other than cruel, hard and inhumane! This is Blindneſs and Impudence, the higheſt Sacrilege and Raſhneſs! We are not contented to wallow in our numberleſs Tranſgreſſions, and to be guilty of all in the preſence of God, but we muſt turn Accuſers and Proſecutors of the Deity. And what hope, for Gods ſake, can there be, when the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſets up for a Proſecutor of his Judge?</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But, ſay theſe Men, if God do's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Humane Affairs, if he takes care, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects or governs them, why are we more weak and miſerable than all other People? Why do's he ſuffer us to be cruſh'd by Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Foreigners? Why do we bear our Enemies Yoak? To anſwer in ſhort, as I have ſaid before, he do's therefore permit us to ſuffer all theſe Hardſhips, becauſe 'tis but what we deſerve. For let us take a view of that Naughtineſs, Baſeneſs, and Villany of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which I have mention'd before, and then we may judge whether we who live in ſo great Impurities can expect to be better protected. Since then many make uſe of this Argument, that becauſe we are miſerable and low, that therefore God do's not regard Things here below, what is it that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? For if in the midſt of ſo many Vices, if in the Commiſſion of ſo much Wickedneſs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100854:67"/>
he ſhould ſuffer us to be ſtrong, flouriſhing and happy, it might give occaſion to think that God did not at all regard the Iniquities of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſuffer'd ſuch vicious and profligate People to be happy. But ſince he is pleas'd that ſuch wicked and ungodly Sinners ſhould be poor and miſerable, it is the plaineſt Demonſtration, that God do's both behold and judge us, becauſe we ſuffer thoſe very things which we deſerve. I am ſatisfied that we do not think we deſerve ſuch Uſage; and this is a main thing which enhances our Guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not acknowledge that they are our Deſerts. For an impudent Pretence of Innocence is that which ſticks cloſeſt upon harden'd Sinners: and among a Multitude who are guilty of the ſame Miſdemeanor, there is none more Criminal than he who takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be guiltleſs. And therefore we have only this one addition to make to our Baſeneſs, that we eſteem our ſelves to be blameleſs. But granting all this (ſays one of theſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and he one of the worſt of them) certainly it cannot be deny'd, but that we are better than theſe Barbarians, and thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that God do's not mind Humane Affairs, becauſe altho' we are much the better Men, yet we are in Bondage and Subjection to thoſe who are worſe. Well then, we will ſee preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether we are better than theſe Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or no: There is no manner of doubt but that we ought to be much better: And that is one good Reaſon why we are worſe, becauſe 'tis our Duty to be better. For where the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100854:67"/>
Condition and Station is more Honourable the Sin receives a greater Aggravation. Where the perſon of the Offender is more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Fault ariſes in proportion. Thus Theft is a very great Wickedneſs, let it be committed by whom it will; but certainly it is more hainous in one of the firſt Rank, than in a contemptible Beggar. Fornication is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden every man, but yet it would look much worſe in a Clergyman than in an inferior Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And ſo we who are called Chriſtians and Catholicks, if we admit the like Sins as theſe Foreigners do, it would be much worſe in us. For the Sin is much more heinous under the Profeſſion of that holy Title. Where the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege is the greater, there the Sin is the groſſer. For the very Religion which we profeſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns our Practice. The Lewdneſs of one who has profeſs'd Chaſtity is more culpable, than of one who has not. So it is more Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous for him to be drunk who pretends to a great degree of Sobriety. There is nothing more contemptible than a lewd and vicious Philoſopher, for beſide the Deformity of the Vices themſelves, he will be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd upon for his Character. And ſo we, who, all over the World, profeſs the Chriſtian Philoſophy, muſt of neceſſity be thought and reputed to be the worſt of Men, becauſe we have the Title of ſo Glorious a Profeſſion, and yet continue ſinning under the Tyes and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of ſo holy a Religion.</p>

But yet, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I do not ſay this of the whole Body of the <hi>Romans</hi> in General. For in the firſt place, I except all the Religious, and in the next ſome Secular Perſons, as good as the Religious; or if that ſeem too much, ſome who by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of their Actions come very near the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; but all the reſt, or as good as All, are more guilty than the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> For to be more guilty, is to be really worſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100854:68"/>
ſince ſome Men look upon it as irrational and abſurd, that we ſhould be accounted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe, or not much better than the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> or than what <hi>Barbarians,</hi> let us ſee, as I ſaid, how it is. Now I do ſtill ſay that, bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only thoſe few of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom I now mention'd, all the reſt, or as good as All, are more guilty and more faulty in their Lives, than the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> When you read this, it may be you grow Paſſionate, and beſide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn what you read. I ſubmit to your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Condemn me if I lye; condemn me if I do not prove it, and condemn me, if I do not ſhew that the Sacred Scriptures have ſaid as much as I ſay now. We then judge our ſelves to be much better than All the reſt of the World, nor do I, who aſſert that the <hi>Romans</hi> are in ſome Things worſe, deny but that in ſome Things they are much better. For our Lives, and our Sins, as I ſaid, are worſe; but then we have the Advantage without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon by our Catholick Law. But then we ſhould conſider, 'tis no Thanks to us that our Law is good; but that our Lives are bad, is wholly owing to our ſelves. And what do's it profit us that the Law is good, when neither our Lives nor Converſations are good? For the good Law is the Gift of Chriſt, but a bad Life is from our own Faults. Nay we are by ſo much the more blameworthy, if we are poſſeſs'd of a good Law, and yet are bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders of it; I ſhould rather ſay, ſince we are wicked, we are no regarders of it; for he that obſerves it ill, regards it not at all: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

They are unjuſt, ſo are we; they are covetous, ſo are we; they are faithleſs, ſo are we; they are griping, ſo are we; they are lewd, and ſo are we; in ſhort, they are guilty of all ſorts of Wickedneſs and Debauchery, and ſo are we; But perhaps it will be anſwer'd to this: If the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and we are alike vicious, Why are not we upon the level with them in Power? For ſince the Wickedneſs and the Guilt is a like, we ought either to be as Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as they are, or they ſhould be in as mean a Condition as we are. That is true; and by this 'tis manifeſt that they are the more wicked, who are the more weak. How do you prove that?

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100854:70"/>
Traders, who now fill the greateſt part of every City, and ſee whether their Life be any thing elſe but continual Plodding how to cheat, and downright thread-bare Lying, or if they do not take thoſe words to be utterly loſt which do not bring ſome Advantage to the Speaker.

Can we think it ſtrange then that <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhould cheat, who know not the Sin of Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? For being utterly ignorant of God's Commandments, they do nothing in Contempt of them; for he who knows not the Law, can do nothing wittingly againſt it.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100854:70"/>
as I ſaid before of the <hi>Franks,</hi> the Name of Chriſt ſeems now not to imply the Sacredneſs of an Oath, but only a ſort of Cant in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

For there are many who ſwear by Chriſt that they will do, not only ſome trivial, idle Buſineſs, but the greateſt of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies: with ſuch 'tis the common Form of Speaking: By Chriſt I'll take away ſuch a Thing, By Chriſt I'll ſlay him, By Chriſt I'll murder him. And ſo far are they arriv'd, that if they have once ſworn by the Name of Chriſt, they take themſelves bound moſt religiouſly to commit the Sin.

This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and prodigious Wickedneſs! To what Baſeneſs will not Men's wicked Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions draw them! They arm themſelves for Pillaging and Plunder by the Name of Chriſt, and make even God the Author of their Crimes; and when Chriſt is the Prohibitor and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Wickedneſs whatever, they tell you they commit it purely for Chriſt's ſake. And do we complain of the Iniquities of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and accuſe Heathens and Barbarians of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100854:71"/>
Perjury! With how much leſs Fault do they forſwear by their Doemons than we by our Lord! How much leſs a Crime is it to play and trifle with the name of <hi>Jupiter</hi> than that of Chriſt! In that caſe there is only a dead Man who is ſworn by: But in the other 'tis the living God who is forſworn by. In that there's not ſo much as a meer Man, but here the Almighty God. In our caſe there's a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the greateſt Oath, and therefore of neceſſity the greateſt Guilt and Perjury. In their's, ſince there's as good as no Oath, there can be no Perjury. For ſince it is not a God by whom they ſwear, it cannot be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury when they chance to break it. But whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has a mind to know the Truth of this, let him hear the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> delivering the ſame Doctrine that I do now: For thus<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</note> he ſays: <hi>We know that whatſoever the Law ſays, it ſpeaks to thoſe who are under the Law.</hi> And<note place="margin">

Who are they therefore who are now under the Law? Who ſhould they be but the Chriſtians; ſuch as the Apoſtle was, who ſays of himſelf: <hi>I am not without the Law of God, but am under</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100854:72"/>
when they ſin, are the Tranſgreſſors of the Law, but the Heathen who know nothing of the Law do ſin without Tranſgreſſion: Becauſe no one can be a Tranſgreſſor of that Thing which he do's not know. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the onely Tranſgreſſors of the Divine Law; we who, as the Scripture ſays, read the Law, but do it not, and ſo by that means our Knowledge is nothing elſe but our Fault, ſince we have known the Law to no other End, but to break it with greater Aggravation: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what we have known by Reading, we have contemn'd and deſpis'd by our Pride and Luſts.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100854:72"/>
call'd Chriſtians, ſince we act and live at ſuch a rate, as that we are a Scandal to Chriſt, by the bearing of his holy Name. But on the other ſide, what like this can be ſaid of any of the Heathen? Can it be ſaid of the <hi>Huns;</hi> See what ſort of People theſe are who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians? Can it be ſaid of the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Franks;</hi> Behold the Actions of thoſe who ſtile themſelves the Worſhippers of Chriſt? Is our moſt holy Law blam'd for the bruitiſh Carriage of the <hi>Moors?</hi> Do the barbarous Rites of the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Gepids,</hi> cauſe the Name of our Lord and Saviour to be evil ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of and blaſphem'd? Can it be ſaid of any of theſe; where is the Catholick Law which they believe? Where are the Precepts of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chaſtity which they learn? They read the Goſpels, and yet are lewd: they hear the Apoſtles, and yet are Drunkards; they follow Chriſt, and yet love Rapine, they lead a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Life; and yet Brag of the Goodneſs of their Law. Can ſuch Things as theſe be ſaid of any of thoſe Nations, no, not by any means: 'Tis of Us, and only us, of whom they are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid. 'Tis in us that Chriſt is ubraided, 'tis through us that the Chriſtian Law is evil ſpoken of. 'Tis of us that what I mention'd above, is ſaid: Lo, what ſort of People they are who worſhip Chriſt. Their Pretence of Learning only good Things is Sham and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as well as their Brags of the Excellency and Holineſs of their Law. For if they learn'd what was good, they would be good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſuch is the Religion as are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100854:73"/>
of it. Undoubtedly they are ſuch as they have been taught to be. It is plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Prophets they have, do teach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs; that the Apoſtles they read, have publiſh'd wickedneſs, and the Goſpels they are principl'd in, do inſtruct them in ſuch Actions. If Chriſt had taught them holy Things, his Followers would certainly live holy Lives. One may gueſs what a One he is, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd, by the Practice of thoſe who worſhip him. How can the Maſter ever have been good, whoſe Diſciples we ſee, are ſo very bad? For from him they are call'd Chriſtians, 'tis him they hear, and him they read. Any one may eaſily underſtand the Doctrine of Chriſt. Look and ſee the Chriſtian's Actions, and you'll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceive what 'twas that Chriſt taught. But what wicked and baſe Thoughts the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then always had of our Lord's Religion, may be learn'd from the moſt Cruel Tortures of their barbarous Perſecutors, who believ'd that in the Chriſtian Sacrifices there was nothing but Impurity and abominable Wickedneſs. For they thought the very beginnings of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion came from two of the greateſt Villanies; from Murder, and then, which is worſe than Murder, from Inceſt; not from Murder and Inceſt only, but, which is ſtill more wicked, from the Inceſt it ſelf and Murder; from the Inceſt of pious Mothers, and the Murder of their innocent Babes, which they believ'd were not only murder'd by the Chriſtians, but eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en alſo, and all this to pacify their God; as tho' any thing could have more offended Him:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100854:73"/>
An odd ſort of Expiation of ones Sin, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as great or greater: To recommend a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by thoſe Things which the Lord does moſt abhor; and as if it could be worth our while to gain eternal Life, if poſſibly it could be compaſs'd, by ſuch monſtrous Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. We may from hence perceive what ſort of People the Heathen took the Chriſtians to be, who worſhipp'd their God with ſuch Sacrifices, or elſe what ſort of God it was they pray'd to, who taught them ſuch ſort of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But how came they to have ſuch Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of us? How ſhould it be but from thoſe who bear the Name of Chriſtians, but in Reality are not, who by their Sins and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs diſgrace their Religion, who, as the Scripture ſays, <hi>Profeſs that they know God, but</hi>

                  <hi>is evil ſpoken of,</hi> and the moſt holy Name of our Lord God is violated by the evil Tongues of ſacrilegious Men? But how heinous and particular a Sin it is, to cauſe the ſacred Name of God to be blaſphem'd among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we learn from the Example of <note n="h" place="margin">See Book the Second.</note> holy <hi>David,</hi> who, when in conſideration of his many righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Actions, he was thought worthy to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape eternal Puniſhment by only one Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Fault, yet could not obtain pardon of this Sin, tho' he ſought it by the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Repentance. For when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſaid to him, after he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd his Fault, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100854:74"/>
Sin, thou ſhalt not die,</hi> he adds immediately;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam 12. v. 13. v.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Howbeit, becauſe by this Deed thou haſt given great Occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the Child alſo that is born unto thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> And what follow'd after? Why, his Crown caſt off, and Jewels laid aſide: his Robes put by, and all his Royal Ornaments remov'd, inſtead of theſe he became Solitary, Penſive, ſhut up, cloath'd in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, all moiſt with Tears, and cover'd over with Aſhes; he begg'd the Life of the young Babe with ſuch a Crowd of Lamentations, and aſſaulted the God of Mercies with ſo great Prayers and Addreſſes; but after all theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications, it was not to be granted, when yet, which is the moſt powerful Help in Prayer, he pray'd in Faith, that what he ask'd of God he ſhould obtain. By which we may ſee that there is ſcarce a Crime of deeper Dye, than to give occaſion to the Gentiles to blaſpheme. For he who ſins grievouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Blaſphemy of others, only draws Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon himſelf; But he who makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to blaſpheme, carries them headlong with him to Deſtruction; and 'tis of neceſſity that he be guilty, for ſo many as he drew with him into Sin. But this is not all. For whatſoever ſinner do's ſo offend, as not to cauſe others to blaſpheme by ſuch Sin, he has only upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Guilt of his own Tranſgreſſion, but the moſt holy Name of God does not ſuffer by the Sacrilegious Tongues of Blaſphemers. But he who by his Sinning cauſes others to blaſpheme, do's neceſſarily make his Sin above
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100854:74"/>
the ſtandard of common Humane Crimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he offers the greateſt Injury imaginable to God himſelf by the encouraging ſuch a Multitude of Blaſphemers.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. This then, as I ſaid, is a Malignity peculiar to the Chriſtians: becauſe God is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem'd only by thoſe who learn what's good, yet practiſe the quite contrary, who, as the Scripture ſays, confeſs <hi>God in their Words, but</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit. 1. v.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>deny him by their Deeds;</hi> who, as the ſame Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Reſt in the Law, and know his will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2. v. 17, 18. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>approve the things that are more excellent, who have the form of Knowledge, and of the Truth in the Law, who preach that a man ſhould not ſteal and yet ſteal; who read that a man ſhould not commit Adultery, and yet commit the Sin, who make their boaſt of the Law, and yet by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law do diſhonour God.</hi> And ſo by this the Chriſtians become much worſe, who ought to be much better. For they do not give proofs of what they profeſs, but rather contradict their Profeſſion by their bad Morals. And wickedneſs committed under a good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is more Damnable, and a holy Name en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances the Guilt of the Sinner. So our Saviour in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſpeaks to the lukewarm Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:<note place="margin">

as I ſaid, no body can deſpiſe that of which he has no knowledge. 'Tis we then that are the Contemners and Tranſgreſſors of the Law, and by ſo much are worſe than theſe Pagans: Becauſe they have not known God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but we have known them: They have them not, but we have them: They do not practiſe things that they never heard of, but we tread under foot what we read and hear. And therefore there is only Ignorance to be laid to their Charge, but Sin and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion at our doors: For 'tis a much leſs heinous Offence not to know the Law, than after the Knowledge of it to contemn it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Am very well ſatisfied that many of the<note place="margin">Of the Law, and its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and how good they are, if we uſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note> greateſt Libertines, and of thoſe who are not capable of receiving the Truth, may object againſt all that I have ſaid and urge, that if the Guilt of wicked Chriſtians be ſo Great, that by their neglecting thoſe Commands of God, which they do know, they ſin more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly than the Heathen People who know nothing of them; that then the Ignorance of theſe is much more Advantageous to them, than Knowledge would have been; and that the having come to the knowledge of the Truth, makes much againſt the others. But the Anſwer to theſe Men is eaſie; That it is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100854:77"/>
not the Truth which is againſt them, but their own Vices, 'tis not the Law that hurts them, but their own Morals. For let our Manners be good, and the Law will be on our ſide. Let us leave off Sinning, and then we ſhall have Profit from the Law. <hi>For we know,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>that the Law is good, if a man</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim. 1. v.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>uſe it lawfully.</hi> Uſe the Law then lawfully, and it will be of advantage to you. <hi>For we know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully, knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteons man.</hi> And for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do you begin to be righteous, and ſo you will be free from the Law; for that Law can never come againſt thoſe Morals which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready altogether conſonant to it. <hi>For we know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully, knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and profane,—and if there be any other thing that is contrary to ſound Doctrine.</hi> So that you may ſee by this, O Man, that the Law is not ſo much againſt you, as you are againſt the Law; it is not contrary to you when it commands you what is good, but you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it when you live ill: for it provides for your Welfare by ordering every thing that is righteous, and you contradict it by doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is wicked; ſo that you act not only againſt the Law, but even againſt your own ſelf, for ſo far as you contradict it, you act againſt your ſelf; becauſe in the Law is both your Salvation and your Life; ſo that,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100854:77"/>
when you leave off to follow God's Law, you deſert and forſake your own Salvation. Our complaint againſt the Divine Law is much ſuch a one as a poor impatient Sick Man uſes to make of the beſt Phyſician, who, when by his own Fault he has made his Diſtemper worſe, lays the Blame on the Ignorance of the Doctor. As if the beſt Preſcriptions could cure any Infirmity, if the Sick Party does not follow them, or that any Method laid down by a Phyſician can ſet any one upright, unleſs the Sick Party reſolves ſtrictly to purſue it. What good will a bitter Draught do the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, if Syrups be preſently powr'd upon it? What good does the Silence of the by-ſtanders do to a Man in a Phrenſy, when he deſtroys himſelf with his own Noiſe? How can that Antidote work which is follow'd by a larger Doſe of Poyſon? Now the Law is our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and our Vices are the Poyſon: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of the Law cannot cure us, whom the Venom of our Vices does deſtroy. But I have now and formerly ſpoke ſufficiently of theſe Matters; and if there ſhall be occaſion, I ſhall, with God's Aſſiſtance, ſay more to the ſame purpoſe hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the mean time, ſince I have before<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and of Tradition.</note> made mention of two Sorts or Sects of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, viz.</hi> Pagans and Hereticks; becauſe, as I ſuppoſe, I have ſpoken ſufficiently of the Pagans, I ſhall now, as my Method requires, diſcourſe likewiſe of the Hereticks. For it may be urg'd: That altho' the Divine Law does not require at the hands of Pagans, that they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100854:78"/>
ſhould obey thoſe Commandments which they never knew, yet it certainly exacts Obedience from the Hereticks, who do know them; for that they read the ſame things which we read, and have the ſame holy Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; and that therefore the Law is not leſs neglected by them, than 'tis by us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed much more; becauſe they have the Advantage of reading the ſame Scriptures we do, and yet do much worſe Things than our People. Let us therefore take a view of Both. They read, ſay you, the ſame Things that are read by us. How I pray you, can thoſe things be ſaid to be the ſame, which have been formerly by wicked hands moſt lewdly corrupted, and depend on worſe Tradition? So that they are not the ſame, becauſe thoſe things cannot be ſaid to be altogether the ſame, which are faulty in any one of their Parts. For they can have no ſafety in them, ſince they have loſt their Perfection, nor have they always continued in the ſame State, which are depriv'd of the efficacy of the Sacraments. 'Tis We therefore alone that have the ſacred Scriptures perfect, uncorrupted, and entire, who either drink of them at the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head, or by the aſſiſtance of a juſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation have drawn them from their pureſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals. 'Tis only We that read them truly; and I would to God, we fulfill'd the Contents of them as truly as we read them rightly. But I fear that we, who do not obſerve them well, do not read them well neither: becauſe there do's leſs Guilt acrue by not reading holy things
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100854:78"/>
at all, than by diſobeying the good Things we do read. For other Nations either have not the Law of God, or they have it tatter'd and corrupted; and ſo by that means, as I ſaid before, they have not at all what they have only ſo. And altho' there may be ſome of theſe Barbarians, who may ſeem to have the holy Scripture not ſo much abus'd and alter'd, yet they have it corrupted with the Tradition of their antient Founders, ſo that they have rather a Tradition than the Scripture, becauſe they do not adhere to what the Truth of the Text directs, but to the wicked Gloſs inſerted by their naughty Tradition. For they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Barbarians, ignorant not only of the<note place="margin">Of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth.</note> 
                  <hi>Roman,</hi> but even of all Humane Learning, who know nothing in the World but what they hear from their own Doctors, and what they hear, That they follow; ſo that 'tis of neceſſity that they, who, being thus without all Learning and Knowledge, do come to know the ſacred Truths of the Divine Law, by Doctrine rather than by Reading, ſhould rather retain that Doctrine than the Law it ſelf. And ſo the Tradition of their Teachers and their accuſtomed Doctrine, is to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Law; becauſe they know nothing elſe but juſt what they are taught. They are then Hereticks, but not wilful ones. They are reckon'd Hereticks with us, but not among themſelves. For they fancy themſelves ſo good Catholicks, that they beſtow the civil Title of Hereticks, even upon us. So that we are the ſame to them that they are to us. We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100854:79"/>
that they are injurious to the divine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, when they aſſert the Son to be leſs than the Father: And they think we are as injurious to the Father, becauſe we believe both to be equal. We have the Truth with us, but they preſume that they have it among them. The true Honour of God is among us; but they fancy that what they believe is more for the Honour of the Deity. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and unneighbourly; and 'tis one of the greateſt pieces of their Religion to be ſo. They are ungodly; but yet they think 'tis true Piety to be ſo. 'Tis plain therefore they are in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but yet they err with an honeſt Mind, not out of Hatred, but of love to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they love and honour our Lord. Altho' they have not the right Faith, yet they nevertheleſs believe this to be the perfect Love of God. How they ſhall be hereafter puniſh'd for this Error and miſtaken Opinion, no body can tell but the Judge: And in the mean time, I preſume, God Almighty affords them his long-ſuffering, becauſe he ſees them, altho' not right in their Creed, yet to be miſtaken with a Deſire of entertaining the true Opinion; and eſpecially ſince he knows that they do all thro' Ignorance, but our People neglect thoſe things which they believe; ſo that they ſin purely thro' the Fault of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but our People by their own; they are ignorant, ours very knowing; they do that which they take to be the right, but our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that which they know to be wrong. And therefore by a moſt juſt Judgment the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100854:79"/>
of God ſupports them, and ſeverely puniſhes us: Becauſe Ignorance may in ſome ſort be excus'd, but Contempt can never me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a Pardon. For thus ſays the Scripture: <hi>The Servant who knows not the will of his Lord, and does it not, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk. 12. v.</hi> 47, 48.</note> 
                  <hi>but he who knows his Will, and does it not, ſhall be beaten with many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Let us not wonder then if we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted many ways, becauſe we ſin not for want of Knowledge, but out of Perverſneſs. For tho' we know what is good, yet we do it not; tho' we underſtand the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Vertue and Vice, yet we follow the latter; we read the Law, and yet trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Contents of it, and make our ſelves acquainted with its ſacred Sanctions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, for no other end, but to ſin more heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after we are forbidden to do it. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip God, and yet are downright Vaſſals to the Devil. And notwithſtanding all this, we are for receiving all good Things from the hand of God, when we are heaping one Wickedneſs upon the head of another. We would have him to fulfil our Deſires, when we will not perform his Will; And behave our ſelves as tho' we were Superior to our Maker. We deſire that God Almighty always ſhould obey our Wills, when all of us live in Contradiction to His. But he is juſt and righteous, and we are wicked and unjuſt. For he puniſhes thoſe he thinks worthy of it, and bears with thoſe who deſerve Forbearance: and both as Means to one and the ſame End;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100854:80"/>
that Chaſtiſement might put a ſtop to the Luſt of Sinning in the Catholicks, and that his long-ſuffering might ſome time bring the Hereticks to the perfect knowledge of the Truth; eſpecially ſince he may think thoſe not altogether unworthy of the Catholick Faith, whom he ſees to live much better Lives than the Catholicks. Now all thoſe I am thus diſcourſing of are either <hi>Vandals</hi> or <hi>Goths:</hi> For I do not ſpeak one word of the <hi>Roman</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who are almoſt innumerable, neither do I compare them either to <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> becauſe the Errors in their Faith make them worſe than the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Lives more baſe than the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> But this is ſo far from being a pleaſing Thought, that 'tis a greater weight than the Load which we have laid upon our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe whom I am forc'd to give this Scurvy Character of, are <hi>Romans.</hi> And this may let us ſee what the whole Body of the <hi>Romans</hi> may deſerve, when one part of them affront God by wicked living, and the other both in Doctrine and Life. Nay and with this further, that even theſe very Hereſies of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> have formerly had their riſe from the Naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <note n="a" place="margin">The <hi>Goths</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> to pleaſe the Emperor <hi>Valens.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Government, ſo that 'tis altogether our Fault that theſe Barbarous People ever had Hereſies among them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But as to what relates to the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Of Envy.</note> of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> what is there in which we can prefer our ſelves before, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves to them? And in the firſt place, to begin with Love and Charity (which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100854:80"/>
our Lord teaches us, is one of the Chief Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues, and which he recommends to us not only thro' all the Sacred Scriptures, but even in His own Perſon, when he ſays; <hi>By</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John 13. v.</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>this ſhall all men know that you are my Diſciples, if ye have love to one another.</hi>) Now almoſt all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> who are of one Country and Government, generally love each other; but all the <hi>Romans</hi> generally take care to perſecute one another. For who is that Citizen, who do's not envy his Fellow-Citizen? Who is there that loves his Neighbour throughly? They all are abſent in Affection, tho' not in diſtant Places; altho' they are joyn'd in Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, their Minds are far aſſunder. And I would to God this were all, tho' one of the greateſt Plagues, and that 'twere only thus with Fellow-Citizens and Neighbours. That is much worſe, that even Kinſmen do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duties of their Kindred. Where is that Relation that ſhews himſelf ſuch to his Kindred? Who is there pays to Love what he acknowledges to owe, even to the very Name? Who is that in Reality which he is ſaid to be? Who is ſo near allied in hearty Affection as in Blood, in whom curſed Malice and Emulation do not burn, whoſe ſole baſe Envy has not ſeis'd, and whom another's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity does not put upon the wrack? Who do's not reckon another Man's good Fortune his own Miſery? Who is ſo ſatisfied with his own Happineſs, as to be content that another ſhould be ſo as well as he? For many now are poſſeſs'd with a new and an unaccountable
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100854:81"/>
Plague; they have no Enjoyment of their own Happineſs, unleſs they are ſure others are unhappy. How very cruel, and extreamly impious, how far from the Practice of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and how very common among the <hi>Romans</hi> is it to Ruine each other by Fines and Outlawries; but I miſtake when I ſay <hi>each other;</hi> if 'twere ſo, 'twould be more tolerable that one Party ſhould ſuffer what he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon another: But this is the Miſchief that many are proſcrib'd by a few, who make a Prey of the publick Fines, and what bears the Title of a Debt to the Treaſury, is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to private Pockets; and this not only by the Great ones, but their Underlings; not only the Judges, but by their meaneſt Dependents. For what either City, Town, or Village is there, where there are not as many Tyrants as there are Magiſtrates? Altho' it may be, they pleaſe themſelves with the Name, becauſe it makes them look Big and Stately: For ſo 'tis with all Thieves, who pride and glory when they are reported to be much more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring than they really are. What place is there then, as I ſaid, where the very Bowels of Widdows and Orphans are not devour'd by the Governours of Cities, and with them thoſe of almoſt all holy Men? For they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon of them as of Widdows and Orphans; becauſe out of Reſpect to their Profeſſion they will not defend themſelves, or thro' their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Humility they cannot. So that there is not one of theſe ſafe, nor any others, except the Great ones, free from the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100854:81"/>
of this Torrent of Thievery, unleſs thoſe who are in every reſpect as very Thieves as themſelves: Nay to ſuch a pitch is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery arriv'd, that unleſs a Man be very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he cannot be ſafe.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Well, however, ſince there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Good.</note> who deſtroy the Good, without doubt there are ſome who in the midſt of the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity do aſſiſt and protect them, who, as the Scripture ſays, <hi>Deliver the Poor and Needy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. 14. v. 2. 53. v.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>from the hand of the Oppreſſor.</hi> No. <hi>There is none that doeth good, no not one:</hi> And he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays, <hi>no not one,</hi> becauſe good Men are ſo very ſcarce, that they ſeem all to be contracted into one. For who can aſſiſt the Diſtreſſed and Afflicted, when even the Chriſtian Prieſts do not withſtand the Oppreſſion of wicked Men? For many of them either hold their Tongues altogether, or ſpeak to as little Effect as if they had held them; and this many of them do, not out of Cowardice, but adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they think, and with Reaſon. They will not declare the plain Truth, becauſe the Ears of wicked Men cannot bear it; they do not only refuſe to hear it, but even hate and abominate it; they do not only not fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence it when they hear it, but deſpiſe it with the greateſt rebellious Pride and Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. So that they who can ſpeak, keep ſilence, whilſt ſometimes they ſpare the Wicked, and will not produce to them the Force of open Truth, leſt they ſhould make them worſe by a too earneſt preſſing of the Truth upon them. And thus it comes that the Poor are Oppreſs'd,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100854:82"/>
Widdows mourn, Orphans are trod under foot, inſomuch, that many of them, well born and genteely bred, fly over to the Enemy, for Fear of Dying here under the publick Perſecution, going to ſeek the <hi>Roman</hi> Humanity among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> becauſe they cannot undergo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous<note place="margin">The Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </note> Inhumanity among the <hi>Romans.</hi> And altho' they differ from thoſe they fly to, both in their Rites, and Language; and, as I may ſo ſay, in the ungrateful Scent of their Bodies and awkward Cloathing, yet they had rather bear with a different Habit among the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> than with raging Injuſtice among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> And therefore from all Parts they ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle either to the <hi>Goths,</hi> or the <hi>Bacaudae,</hi> or to<note place="margin">Outlaws or Outliers of <hi>Gaul.</hi>

For how came the <hi>Bacaudae</hi> to be ſuch, but by our Injuſtice, and the Wickedneſs of their Judges, but by the Proſcription and Rapine of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the publick Tribute to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gains, and have made the Peoples Taxes only a Prey for themſelves? Who like the moſt Savage Beaſts, have not ſo much govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe put under their Care, as they have devour'd them, not being ſatisfied with the Spoils of the Men, as moſt Thieves are uſed to be, but have torn them piece-meal; and, as I may ſay, have gorg'd themſelves with their very Blood. And thus it came that the Men being ſuffocated and murder'd by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious open Robberies of their Governours, began to be in a manner <hi>Barbarians,</hi> becauſe they were not permitted to be Romans. They were ſatisfied to be what they were not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100854:83"/>
they were not ſuffer'd to be what they had been; and were forc'd at leaſt to defend their Lives, becauſe they ſaw plainly they had utterly loſt their Liberty already. And what are we doing now, but the very ſame thing that was done before, that is, that they who already are not <hi>Bacaudae,</hi> ſhall be forc'd to be ſuch. For as far as Violence and Injury can go, they are compell'd to be willing to be ſo; but then their Weakneſs hinders them, that they are not ſuch. So that they are as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives groaning under the Enemies Yoak. They endure the Hardſhip out of Neceſſity, but not Choice; they with all their heart would be free, and yet undergo the greateſt Slavery.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And thus it is that we deal with almoſt<note place="margin">Of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> all of the meaner Sort. For by one thing they are ſtreighten'd to two the moſt different. The greateſt violence prompts them to a Deſire of Aſpiring to their Liberty, but the ſame Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence do's not ſuffer them to accompliſh what it forces them to deſire. But it may be, theſe Men are blam'd, becauſe they do deſire it, when all they covet is, that they may not be forc'd to deſire it: For 'tis their greateſt Misfortune that they do deſire it; And they would be much better dealt with, if they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to have ſuch a Deſire. But how can theſe poor Creatures otherwiſe chuſe than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Liberty, who undergo the daily, nay hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ruine of publick Taxes, who have the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Grievous and never ceaſing Proſcription hanging over their Heads, who deſert their Dwellings leſt they ſhould be tortur'd in their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100854:83"/>
own Houſes, and run into Baniſhment to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Puniſhment? Publick Enemies are more mild to theſe than the Collectors: For ſo 'tis plain in Fact, they run over to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to avoid the Violence of the Taxing. And even all this, tho' it be hard and inhumane, yet would be leſs grievous and unpleaſant, if all did bear it equally and alike. 'Tis moſt ſhameful and tormenting that all do not bear the Burden of All; that the Tribute due from the Rich, is laid on the poorer Sort, and the Weak bear the Burdens of the Strong. Nor is there any other Reaſon that they cannot bear them, only that the Burden of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable People is greater than their Eſtate. They ſuffer two the moſt different and unlike Things, Envy and Poverty. Envy is in the Great Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Poverty in the Eſtate. If you look at what they pay, you would take them to be very Rich; but if you mind what they have, you will find them miſerably Poor. Who can ſufficiently ſet forth this Myſtery of Iniquity? They bear the Payment of the Rich, and the Indigence of the Beggars. But I have much more to ſay to this Matter. The Great ones ſometimes make Additi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nal Taxes, for which the poorer Sort are ſure to pay. But, ſay you: ſeeing their Eſtaes and Revenues are much the Greater, how comes it about that they ſhould be willing to encreaſe their own Debt? You don't hear me ſay that they do encreaſe it. For it is for that Reaſon they do augment it, becauſe it is not augmented on themſelves, and I will tell you how. There do often come
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100854:84"/>
freſh Couriers and Expreſſes ſent from the higher Powers, who are recommended to a few Great Perſons, to the Ruine of a great many others. For theſe, there is preſently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſome new Preſents, and ſo new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies muſt be made. The Great ones decree what the meaner Sort muſt pay, the Favour of the Rich orders, what a whole Herd of Wretches muſt diſcharge. For they do not in any wiſe feel the Weight of their own Decrees. But, you'll ſay, thoſe that come from the Higher Powers muſt be Reſpected and Treated hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely. I grant ye, but pray then do you Great ones be the firſt to Gratifie them, who are ſo ready to order others to do it. Be you the firſt in beſtowing your Money who are the firſt in the Liberality of your Words: You who give of my Suſtance, pray ſpare a little out of your own: Altho' in Juſtice you, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, who ſolely expect the Thanks, ſhould ſolely bear the Expence. Well, we poor Knaves reſt ſatisfied in the good Will and Pleaſure of you Rich ones. Let all of us pay what a few of you command: Can any thing have more of Juſtice or Humanity in it? Your Orders ſtill load us with new Debts: Pray at leaſt let the Debt be in Common between us both. For can any thing be more unrighteous or unworthy, than that you alone ſhould be free from the Debt, who are the Parties who make us all Debtors? And really the poor People are moſt miſerable that pay all this I have been ſpeaking of, and neither know why nor wherefore they pay it. For who dare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100854:84"/>
why he pays, or who is ſuffer'd to find out what his Debt is? But then it comes out when the Great ones fall out among themſelves, when ſome of them take ſnuff that ſome things have been decreed without their Advice and Approbation. Then you may hear ſome of them ſay: <hi>What ſtrange Doings are theſe! Two or three order what will be the Ruine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; a few Great ones decree what muſt be rais'd upon a great many very poor ones.</hi> For every one of theſe Rich ones ſo far gratifies his own Pride, that he would not have any thing paſs in his Abſence, and not out of any Reſpect he has to Juſtice, to ſtop the paſſing of any unrighteous Thing when he was preſent. For what they had found fault with in others, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either to revenge the former Slight, or to ſhew their own Power, do afterwards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh. So that the poor unhappy meaner People are plac'd, as it were, in the middle of the Sea, amidſt the contending Storms, are ſometimes overwhelm'd with the Waves of one ſide, and ſometimes with thoſe of the other.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But I warrant you thoſe who have been thus hard in this particular, are more juſt and moderate in others, and make Amends for the Badneſs of one Buſineſs by the fair Dealing in another. And as in the Impoſition of freſh Supplies they bear hard on the poorer Sort, ſo they ſupport and aſſiſt them by the freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: and as the leſſer People were moſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd with the new Taxes, ſo they are moſt eas'd by the new Remedies. No, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100854:85"/>
is alike in both Caſes. For as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er People are the firſt in the Burden, ſo they are the laſt in the Relief from it. And if at any time, as it lately happen'd, the Higher Powers have thought fit that the Taxes of ſome decay'd Cities ſhould be leſſen'd, the Great ones immediately part that Remedy that was given in common to all, among themſelves. No one then thinks of the Poor: Nor calls the mean and needy to the partaking of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He who is always firſt in bearing of the Burden, ſhall in the laſt place receive the Eaſe from. And what ſhall I ſay more? The poorer Sort are not reckon'd to be Scot and Lot Men, unleſs when the Load of Tribute is put upon them, but when a Remedy is to be ſhar'd, they are caſt out of the Number. Do we think then that we do not deſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Divine Vengeance, when we are thus always oppreſſing of the Poor! Or do we believe, ſeeing we are perpetually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that God will not as conſtantly exerciſe his Juſtice upon us? For where or among what People, unleſs among the <hi>Romans</hi> only, will you find ſuch wicked Dealings as theſe? Whoſe injuſtice is ſo great as this of ours? The <hi>Franks</hi> know nothing of this Villany. The <hi>Huns</hi> are abſolutely free from it. There is no ſuch thing among the <hi>Vandals;</hi> nothing of it among the <hi>Goths.</hi> For ſo far are the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> among the <hi>Goths</hi> from bearing any thing of this Nature, that the very <hi>Romans</hi> who live among them feel nothing of it. So that it is the unanimous Prayer of all thoſe <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100854:85"/>
that they may never be forc'd again to come under the Power of the <hi>Romans.</hi> There 'tis the Peoples conſtant and daily Wiſh, that they may ſtill lead the Life they now live among the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And yet we admire that the <hi>Goths</hi> are not routed by our Armies, when our own People chuſe rather to live with them, than with us. So that our Countrymen will not only not return from them to us, but deſert us to go over to them. And really, it ſeems a little ſtrange to me, that all the Poor and meaner Sort, who are aſſeſs'd to the Taxes, do not all go over, and there ſeems to be only one Reaſon why they have not done it; Becauſe they cannot carry over with them the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Remnants of their Fortunes, their poor Cots and Families. For ſince many of them are forc'd to quit their little Fields and ſorry Huts, to avoid the Violence of the Exactions, how would they not leave what they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to, but if 'twere poſſible, would carry it off with them. However, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accompliſh this, which, it may be, they had rather, they ſtrike up with the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that is left them. They throw themſelves into the Guardianſhip and Protection of the Great ones: They ſurrender themſelves into rich Men's hands, and entirely put themſelves under their Power and Juriſdiction. I ſhould not take this to be any great Burden or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, but ſhould rather commend this Power of the Great ones, to whom theſe poor People ſurrender themſelves, if they did not ſell their Protections, and when they gave
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100854:86"/>
them ſuch Shelter, they did it out of Charity or good Nature, and not for ſordid Lucre. But 'tis very hard and cruel, that they only ſeem to Protect them, that they may Plunder them; they defend them only on Condition, that they may make thoſe who are miſerable already, to be much more ſo. For all who are under this ſeeming Protection, make over almoſt All their whole Eſtates to their Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, before they can procure the Favour; and ſo the Children loſe their Inheritance, that the Fathers may gain a Protection. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Parents is procur'd with the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary of the whole Family. And theſe are the Grand Helps and Protections of the Great ones. They give not a Croſs to thoſe who are under their Patronage, but keep all to themſelves. And thus the Parents for ſome ſmall while, have a little Advantage, that afterward the Whole may be taken from their Children. So that the Great ones ſell, and ſell at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rate they can, every Favour that they do: And what I call ſelling, I wiſh they would ſell after the uſual Method; for then, it may be, the Buyer might reſerve ſomewhat for himſelf. But this is a new and unheard of Way of Buying and Selling. The Seller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers nothing, and yet receives all. The Buyer receives nothing, and yet utterly loſes all. And ſince this is common almoſt in all Bargains, that the Buyer is generally the Richer, and the Seller the Poorer, for that the Buyer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes with Deſign to encreaſe his Eſtate, and the Seller parts with his Goods in order to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100854:86"/>
it; this kind of Dealing is prodigious, the Seller's Eſtate encreaſes, when the Buyer has nothing left but ſheer Beggary. And how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable and monſtrous, and ſo far from being endur'd by Mankind that 'tis not fit to be heard by them, is this, that many of theſe pitifully Poor, miſerable Wretches, who are robb'd of all that little they had, and driven from their little Lands, even when they have thus loſt their Eſtate, yet ſtill pay the Tax for the Eſtate thus taken from them; and tho' they have loſt the Poſſeſſion of that, their Capitation does not leave them. They have not one jot of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and yet they are over-born with Taxes! Who can ſufficiently ſet forth this Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? The Oppreſſors brood upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and theſe poor Creatures pay the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for them. After the Father's Deceaſe, the Sons, by reaſon of the Father's former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, have not their Lands, and yet are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with the Duties of them. And ſo by theſe Pranks, it comes to paſs, that they who were before ſtript by private Oppreſſion, do yield up the Ghoſt by publick Squeezing, and from whom Robbery had taken away their Eſtate, pilling and polling has taken away their Life. And therefore many of thoſe, who either naturally are more conſiderate, or whom Neceſſity has forc'd ſo to be, when they have either loſt their Houſes and Lands by Oppreſſion, or have been driven from them by the Tax-gatherers, and find they cannot hold them, they ſeek out for the Lands of ſome Great Men, and ſo become Farmers to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100854:87"/>
the Rich. And as they who being affrighted with the Approach of an Enemy, are uſed to betake themſelves to their Strong-holds, or they who have forfeited the Protection of the Government, do in deſpair fly to ſome place of Refuge, even ſo theſe Men, who can no longer enjoy the Seat and Honour of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, betake themſelves to the Drudgery of a pitiful Tenement, being reduc'd to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of being ſtrangers not only to their Eſtate, but even to their former Stations and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Baniſh'd not only from their Fortunes, but even from themſelves, and looſing every thing together with themſelves; they want both a Property in their Goods, and have loſt all Title to their Liberty and Freedom.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And really, ſince Misfortune and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have made it ſo, this mean Condition might, however, be born with, if there were not ſtill ſomewhat worſe. But it is bitter and grievous that there is yet a greater Miſchief follows. For they are receiv'd as Strangers, but their Dwellings prejudice them ſo far as to make them Natives, and after the Pattern of <hi>Circe,</hi> that moſt powerful Enchantreſs, who was ſaid to change Men into Beaſts, all of theſe who are admitted within the Lands of Great Men, are pefectly Metamorphos'd, as by a Draught of <hi>Circe</hi>'s Bowl. For thoſe whom they receive as Foreigners and Aliens, they preſently ſeize as their proper Goods; and thoſe who are well known to be Gentlemen, are converted into Slaves. And do we wonder then if the <hi>Barbartans</hi> carry us away Captive,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100854:87"/>
when we thus captivate our own Brethren? Never think it ſtrange that our Cities are ſack'd and deſtroy'd. We have long taken a world of Pains by the Oppreſſion of very many, that ſo by captivating others, we our ſelves ſhould at length begin to be Captives too. For now we feel, tho' much later than we deſetve; we feel, I ſay, at length, what we have done;<note place="margin">Pſal. 128. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> and, as the holy Scripture ſays, <hi>We eat the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our hands;</hi> and by the juſt Judgment of God, we pay the Debt we owe. We have<note place="margin">Of the Mercy of God.</note> ſhewn no Compaſſion to thoſe who have been Baniſh'd from their own Country, and loe, we our ſelves are now in that Condition? We have put Tricks upon Strangers, and behold, we our ſelves are become Wanderers and are put upon. We have over-reach'd Men of Condition by the Corruption of the Times, and loe, we of late begin to live in a foreign Soil, and yet fear, even now, the like Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions. And, O how Great is the Infidelity and Blindneſs of our naughty Minds! We are now under the Sentence of a Judging God, and yet we do not acknowledge our ſelves to have been adjudg'd. Nay ſome good Men admire that other People, who yet have not ſuffer'd any ſuch thing, are not amended by our Examples, when as we our ſelves, who are now under God's hands, are not the leaſt reform'd by his puniſhing of our Iniquities. O intolerable Pride! Very many bear the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their Iniquities, and yet no body vouchſaſes to underſtand the Cauſe of the Chaſtiſement. But the Reaſon of this Pride
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100854:88"/>
is plain; altho' we do indeed undergo ſome Hardſhips, yet we do not ſuffer what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. For the Mercy of God is ſo Great, that altho' he would have as ſuffer for ſome of our Faults, yet he would not have us bear them all; tho' he puniſhes the Wicked, he cannot do wickedneſs: and he had rather we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our Sins, than bear the Weight of them; that ſo, by thoſe loving and wholeſome Stripes, he might ſhew us what we deſerve to bear, but yet will not lay upon us our Deſerts, according to that of the bleſſed Apoſtle, where he ſays: <hi>Doſt thou not know that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance? But after thy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 2. v.</hi> 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>hardneſs, and impenitent heart treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> We do really juſt thus, as the Apoſtle ſays. For God calls us to Repentance, but we treaſure up Wrath; God invites us to Pardon, but we daily add Sin to Sin. We offer Violence to God for our Iniquities, we arm the Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt us. We force the Almighty againſt his Will to revenge the Outragiouſneſs of our Offences. Nay we almoſt go ſo far as not to give him leave to ſpare us. For ſince there cannot the leaſt ſign of Injuſtice ever happen to, or appear in God, we act ſo, that if he do's not execute Vengeance on our Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick Villanies, he will almoſt ſeem to be unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But ſome one or other was formerly a Sinner, perhaps now he is not; Is there any end of Sinning, and do not Men ſooner leave their Lives than their Iniquities? For where
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100854:88"/>
is one, who do's not die in his Offences, and is buried with, nay in his very Tranſgreſſions? So what That of the Prophet may be truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to them: <hi>Their Graves are their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 48. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>for ever: they are compared unto the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh bruit Beaſts, and are made like unto them.</hi> And I wiſh they were like Beaſts: for it had been better for them to have gone out of the way by bruitiſh Stupidity: Becauſe it is worſe, and enhances the Crime, that they have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, not out of Ignorance, but Contempt. And are they the Laity only that have done this? No, ſome alſo of the Clergy. What, of the Seculars only? No, many alſo of the Religious, who under the Cloak of Religion are enſlav'd to Secular Vices; who after all their former Sins and Debaucheries, taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Title of Sanctity, and being the ſame they ever were in their Converſation, have only by a new Profeſſion chang'd their Name, but not their Lives, and taking the Whole of God's Worſhip to conſiſt more in odd Cloaths, than good Actions, have only put off their former Garments, but not their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. So that thoſe take themſelves to be Offenders with much leſs Cenſure, who, when they are ſaid to do ſomething like Penance, as they do not leave their former Courſes, ſo neither do they change their Habit. For theſe Men do almoſt every thing ſo, that you would not ſo much think they had formerly repented of their Sins, as that they afterward repented of that very Repentance, nor that they had formerly repented ſo much, that they had liv'd
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100854:89"/>
ill, as afterward, that they had ever promis'd to live well. They know that I ſpeak the Truth, and their own Conſciences bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to what I ſay; and that as of many others, ſo particularly to thoſe Religious Hawkers and Courtiers of new Honours; and after they have taken the Name of Penitents upon them, purchaſers of very large and never-before-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd Power. So that they would be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seculars, but much more; 'tis not enough for them to be what they were before, unleſs they ſhould afterward be ſomewhat more than they had been. How then do not ſuch repent of their former Repentance? Even as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo repent, that ever they had a Thought of their Converſion to God, who abſtaining from their own Wives, do not keep their hands from the wrongful taking away of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men's Goods, and when making profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Continence of their Bodies, they run Horn-mad with the Incontinence of their Minds. This is an altogether new ſort of Converſion. They do not do thoſe things they lawfully may, and yet commit thoſe that are unlawful. They refrain from Copulation, but do not refrain from Rapine. What's the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo ridiculous a Perſwaſion? <hi>God hath forbid Sinning, but not Wedding.</hi> Your Actions<note place="margin">☞</note> do not quadrate with your Principles. You ought not to be the Patrons of Vice, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the followers of Virtue. You act moſt prepoſterouſly. This is not a turning to God, but a turning away from him. Since, as the Report go's, you have long ſince left the

work of honeſt Matrimony, pray, likewiſe at length leave off your Sinning: And that, as is fitting, all manner of Sinning: But yet if you cannot refrain from all, becauſe perhaps you take that to be a difficult and impoſſible Task, yet I beſeech you, hold your hand from prodigious and monſtrous Impieties. I grant you, whoever you are, that no Neighbours may hold up, nor mean People live near you. I allow that you be a Perſecutor of many indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent People, and a Deſtroyer of the diſtreſſed; I allow that you be an Afflicter of all, ſo they be foreigners: But I beg of you at length, to ſpare your own Friends, and if not all your own, becauſe, it may be, you judge that to be grievous and burdenſome, if you ſhould ſpare them all; have Compaſſion, at leaſt, on thoſe of your Acquaintance, who have preferr'd you, not only before their Kindred and Neighbours, but before all the deareſt and neareſt Relations in the World. But what ſhould I mention Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Children? They have lov'd you more than their Souls, and all their future hopes, for which they are not to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and he who has done ſo, do's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Miſtake. But what is it to you, who were the Occaſion and Subject of the Miſtake? You are certainly the more indebted, becauſe he offended no otherwiſe but by loving you too much. He was blinded with the Affection he had for you, and was mark'd and check'd by every body for it. But you, however, are ſo much the more oblig'd to him, becauſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf to be blam'd by all Mankind, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Love to you.</p>

What would you do if you did not perceive God's preſent Judgment, even in this next Correction of you? Beſide you add and heap up new Wickedneſſes to your former Crimes.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard others, whom, whether you will or no, you admire. They are above the reſt in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and equal to them in Worth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; they are greater by their Power, but leſſer by their Humility. You, to whom I am now ſpeaking, know well enough, of whom I ſpeak; and you, the ſame, of whom I am now Complaining, ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, whom I am thus deſervedly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending; And I wiſh there were many ſuch who deſerv'd ſuch Commendation; For the Excellencies of many might be the Saving of All. But granting, that you have not a mind to be commended, why, I pray you, do you deſire to be condemn'd? Why is nothing ſo grateful to you as Injuſtice, why nothing ſo pleaſing as Avarice, and nothing ſo dear as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion? Why do you prize nothing of equal Value with Naughtineſs, nor think any thing ſo Excellent as Rapine? Learn at leaſt from a Heathen, what is the ſolid Good. <hi>You ſhould,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be defended by Love and good Will, and not by Arms.</hi> You are therefore miſtaken in your Notions, the Baſeneſs of your blind and deprav'd Underſtanding deceives you. If you would be blameleſs, Powerful, and truly Great, you ſhould ſurmount all others in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions, not in Oppreſſion and Injuſtice. I have formerly read in ſome place or other: <hi>No one is a bad Man, but who at the ſame time is a Fool; for if he were wiſe, he had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

For if ever you deſire ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be really wiſe, or in your right mind, you muſt-entirely change and put off your ſelf. Remove your ſelf then from your ſelf, that you be not rejected by Chriſt. Caſt off your ſelf, that you may be receiv'd by Chriſt. Deſtroy even your ſelf to prevent your periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>For whoſoever,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>will loſe</hi>

And thus my Reader may pleaſe to underſtand, that it was not to no purpoſe that I had ſaid ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove of one wicked Perſon, ſeeing we read that the divine Vengeance has been very often kindled by the Offences of one But I am not ſo ſtrait lac'd as to ſtick upon this: For it is not at all neceſſary to ſuppoſe that any one Man in this Caſe injures all, when all injure each other alike. It is not fit I ſhould think that All are endager'd by One, when all, of their own accord run ſingly into Danger. For all hurry to Deſtruction, or at leaſt, to ſpeak in milder terms, almoſt all. And what good is it to the Chriſtians that the Number of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100854:92"/>
Bad was leſs, or at leaſt the ſame with that of the Good? This is a miſerable Buſineſs, and to be extreamly bemoan'd and lamented! How unlike are Chriſtian People now even to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is, from what they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly! Then St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Chief of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, with a word ſlew <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>

And the bleſſed St. <hi>Paul</hi> threw out of the Church an inceſtuous Perſon, leaſt by his nearneſs, he might infect<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> many. But now we are ſatisfied to have an equal Number of both among us. But what do I ſay, ſatisfied? We ought rather to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and leap for Joy, if we could but once arrive to that Equality. Behold, to what a paſs we are come, how low we are dropp'd after that Purity of Chriſtianity: Behold, we are reduc'd to that, that we ſhould judge the Church happy, if it had only ſo many good People in it as it has bad ones. For how ſhould we not eſteem it happy, if we had but one half inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſince we now bemoan the ſinfulneſs of almoſt All? So that indeed, ſeeing Matters are thus, 'twas to little purpoſe that I ſaid ſo much before of one wicked Perſon; 'twas in vain that I lamented the Iniquities of a ſingle Party. For either all, or almoſt all are to be bemoan'd and lamented. For moſt are either ſuch, or certainly, which is as culpable, deſire to be ſuch, and labour as much as they can by their evil Actions not to be thought behind them, and for that Reaſon, altho' they commit leſſer Ills, becauſe their Abilities are leſs, yet they are not at all the leſs wicked, becauſe they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100854:93"/>
would be as great as the others, if it were in their Power. So that they do what is in their Power, and are as bad as the others in Deſire, Will, and good Wiſhes; and as far as their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will admit, endeavour to out-do them: For there is the ſame Emulation, altho' in quite different things, between theſe Men, as there is between good Men; for as the Good deſire to overcome all others in the Rectitude and Honeſty of their Minds, ſo theſe covet to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all others in the Irregularity and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs. And as it is the Glory of all good Men to become daily better and better, ſo it is the Pride of all bad ones to become worſe and worſe; and as the beſt Men covet to aſcend the higheſt Pitch of all manner of Vertues, ſo the worſt Men deſire the Prize of being Victors in all manner of Vices. But all this is to our Damage, to ours who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who, as I have ſaid before, take Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs for Wiſdom, and of whom God ſpeaks in an eſpecial manner; <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the</hi>

What hope is there then of amendment in us, who are not led to what is evil by any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Opinion, but who take a great deal of pains thro' the Corruption of our deprav'd Wills, that we may always appear to be very bad? And hence it is that I have all along complain'd that we are much worſe than the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> For the Ignorance of the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes them, whilſt the Knowledge of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us.

               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, there is almoſt nothing either ſinful or heinous which is not in the<note place="margin">Of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Sights which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the Minds of Beholders.</note> publick Shews; where it is the greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure imaginable to have Men die upon the Spot, or which is more grievous and cruel than Death, to have them torn in pieces, and the Paunches of wild Beaſts to be gorg'd with the Fleſh of them, to have Men eaten, to the great Pleaſure of the Standers by, and the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Beholders, which is, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by the Eyes of Men, as well as by the Teeth of Beaſts. And to keep theſe up, the whole World is at Expenee. There is all the Care and Pains that can be taken about them. The privateſt Places are applied to; Groves never paſs'd before are view'd, the thickeſt Woods are gone through, the cloudy Alps are climb'd, and ſnowy Vallies penetrated; and that Men's
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100854:94"/>
Bowels may be devour'd by Beaſts, the World and Nature's Secrets, are all ranſack'd. But theſe things, ſay you, are not always done. A very admirable excuſe of the Folly, that they are not always done. As if what is offenſive to God ought to be done at any time, or that bad things were therefore well done, becauſe they were not always done. Rogues and Bandity do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways murder, and yet they are Murderers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, even when they do not commit the Fact, becauſe they are ſometimes defil'd with Murder. And high-way Men are not always upon the Pad, and yet they do not by that ceaſe to be high-way Men, becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they do not actually rob any one of his Goods, yet their minds are ſtill ruminating upon their Robberies. So all thoſe, who are delighted with theſe ſort of Sights, even when they do not ſee them, are not free from the Guilt of thoſe Sights, becauſe they would always ſee them, if they could. But this is not all, there are greater Things than theſe. For, are not young Fowls fed for the Conſuls after the manner of the Gentile Sacrilege, and Auguries taken from their flying, and almoſt all the other Follies acted, which even the old Pagans themſelves look'd upon as ridiculous and childiſh? And when they do all this, who give names to our Years, and from whom the Years themſelves take their Beginning, can we think that ever our Years can ſucceed well, which take their Beginning from ſuch things as theſe? And I could wiſh, that as theſe things are done only for the Conſuls, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100854:94"/>
only thoſe, for whom they are done. For it is lamentable and grievous, that whilſt theſe Things are done by publick Conſent, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a very few becomes the Crime of all; and as there are two elected and admitted each Year, it is almoſt ſo, that no one in the whole World can eſcape.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But let us ſuppoſe that there is enough<note place="margin">Of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres.</note> ſaid of thoſe things, which, as you excuſe them, are not done daily. And let us ſpeak of the Uncleanneſſes acted every day, of which Legions of Devils have found out ſuch Sorts, and ſuch Numbers, that even the honeſteſt and beſt Tempers, altho' they may deſpiſe and trample upon ſome, yet they will ſcarce ever be able to overcome all. For as two Armies about to engage, are ſaid either to cut Ditches, drive Stakes, or other ſharp Inſtruments in the Paſſages through which they expect their Enemies to paſs, not with deſign that each Enemy ſhould fall into them all, but yet that no one ſhould wholly eſcape them, even ſo the Devils have laid ſo many Snares, Baits, and Enticements for Mankind in this Life, that altho' a Man get quit of many of them, yet he is certainly ſnapp'd one way or other. It would be tedious to ſpeak of them all, as of the <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Kennet's</hi> Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities for all theſe.</note> Amphitheatres, Muſick-rooms, Gaming-Houſes, Shews, Wreſtling, Tumblings, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickries, and the other Monſters, which it grieves me to ſpeak of, becauſe I am ſorry ever to have known ſo much Wickedneſs; I ſhall only ſpeak of the Impurities of the <note n="b" place="margin">The places where the <hi>Romans</hi> exhibited their Shews to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> Cirques and Theatres. For the Things are ſuch which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100854:95"/>
are acted there, that a Man cannot not only ſpeak of, but even remember them without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileing himſelf. As for other Crimes, they ſeem only to claim ſome particular Portion in us, as baſe Thoughts the Mind, unchaſt Looks the Eyes, and idle Talk the Ears; ſo that when any one of theſe is faulty, the reſt may be free from Offence. But in the Theatre there is not one of them guiltleſs, our Mind is polluted with Luſts, our Ears by Hearing, and our Eyes by Seeing. All which are ſo very wicked, that one cannot explain, or ſet them forth with common Modeſty. For who with ſafety to his Modeſty, can tell their Repreſentations of filthy Things, the Obſcenity of their Words and Voices, the unſeemlineſs of their Motions, and the uncleanneſs of their Geſtures? The hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of which may hence be gueſs'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not bear the relating. Some even of the greateſt Villainies may be nam'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, without touching the Honour of him who mentions them, ſuch as Murder, Theft, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Sacrilege, and others in like manner. 'Tis only the Impurities of the Theatres, which cannot with Decency be ſo much as accus'd. So that it happens pretty odly to him who would reprove the Baſeneſs of ſuch Uncleanneſs; for certainly he is an honeſt Man, who would offer to accuſe them, but then if he will keep his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty entire, he can neither ſpeak to, nor accuſe them. All other Wickedneſſes defile the Actors, not the Seers, or the Hearers. So altho' you chance to hear one blaſpheme, you are not polluted with the Sacrilege, becauſe your Heart diſſents
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100854:95"/>
from it: And ſo if you chance to be preſent at a Robbery, you are not ſtain'd by the Fact, becauſe you abhor it inwardly. They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Uncleanneſſes of publick Sights, which make the Actors and Spectators culpable alike. For whilſt thoſe who ſee them do approve, and ſee them willingly, they do All by ſuch Sight and Approbation, act them. So that that of the Apoſtle do's truly, in a peculiar manner, fall<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 1. v.</hi> 32.</note> upon them, that <hi>they are worthy of death, not only they who do ſuch things, but alſo they who conſent, and have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> And therefore in the Repreſentations of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, all the whole Body of the People are mental Fornicators; and they who, it may be, came clean to the Play, return Adulterers from the Theatre. But it is not only then, when they return, that they are Fornicators, but even when they come. For, for that very Reaſon that any one deſires an obſcene Thing, whilſt he haſtens to ſuch Unncleanneſs, he is unclean.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Things being thus, loe what are the Actions of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> or at leaſt of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all. And ſince they are ſuch, we who do theſe fine things complain, that we are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Heaven, and ſay that we are deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our God, when 'tis we our ſelves that leave him. For let us ſuppoſe that our Lord had a mind to regard us, tho' we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; let us ſee whether he could do it. There are many thouſands of Chriſtians every day at the beaſtly publick Shews. Can God, think we, look upon ſuch People as they are? Can he regard thoſe, who revel in the Cirque, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100854:96"/>
fornicate in the Theatres? Or have we a mind, and think it very fitting, that when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds us in the Cirques and Theatres, he ſhould be a Spectator of the Sights together with us, and ſhould look upon all the Uncleanneſſes of the place, as well as our ſelves? One of the two muſt neceſſarily be done. For if he vouchſafes to behold us, it follows, that he muſt likewiſe behold the things where we are; or if, which is moſt certain, he turns away his eyes from them, he turns them likewiſe from us, who are preſent at them. And tho' mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are thus, yet we do all this that I have mention'd, and that without ceaſing. What do we think, we have ſuch a God as the old Pagan Theatres and Cirques had? For they did all theſe things heretofore, becauſe they thought they were very pleaſing to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. But on what account can we pretend to do theſe things, who certainly know that they are odious to our God? Or at leaſt, if we are ſure that theſe Filthineſſes are pleaſing to God, I am not againſt the continual acting of them. But then, if we find in our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that this is what God abhors, that he abominates them; that as there is in them the repaſt of the Devil, ſo they are an Abuſe to God; how do we pretend we worſhip God in His Church, when we are continually ſerving the Devil in theſe obſcene Plays, and that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and knowingly, adviſedly, and on ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? And what hope and confidence then can we have in God, who offend him, not by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Imprudence, but like thoſe antient
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100854:96"/>
Gyants, who, we read, madly attempted Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and endeavoured to ſtep into the Clouds. So we by the Affronts, which all over the World we offer to God, do, as by univerſal Conſent offer Violence to Heaven. To Chriſt then (O prodigious Madneſs) to Chriſt, we offer the Games of the Cirque and Mimickries, and then chiefly when we have receiv'd ſome Favour from him, ſome Bleſſing is beſtowed upon us, or when he has given us Victory over our Enemies. And what is this but to offer Injuries to ones greateſt Benefactor, or ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to abuſe one who treats us civilly, or to wound the very face of one who would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute us? For I deſire to know of the Rich and Great Men of this World of what fault they take that Servant to be guilty, who devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Miſchief againſt a kind and loving Maſter, who offers Abuſes to him who deſerves well of him, and for the Liberty which he has gain'd, returns only Injuries and Affronts? He will doubtleſs be thought guilty of the greateſt Crime, who returns Evil for Good, who ought not to have return'd ſo much as Evil for evil. But this is what all we, who are call'd Chriſtians, do. By our Impurities we provoke a moſt merciful God againſt us, by our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs we offend him, who has tenderneſs for us, and by our Injuries wound him, who obliges and courts us.</p>
               <p n="5">V. To Chriſt then (O prodigious Madneſs) to Chriſt we offer Cirque plays and Mimickries; we render to Chriſt, for all the Benefits we have receiv'd from him, the Filthineſs of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres;

to Chriſt we offer the Sacrifices of theſe moſt abominable Paſtimes. Undoubtedly our Saviour became incarnate for us, that he might teach us this. Certainly he preach'd this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelf, or his Apoſtles. For this he underwent the Shame of his Humane Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and took upon him the debaſing Principles of an earthly Birth.

things, for the which, the Apoſtle ſays, Chriſt came into the World: Where are they that deny worldly Luſts; where are they who live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, where are they, who by their good Deeds ſhew, that they look for that bleſſed Hope; and by the Innocence of their Lives demonſtrate, that they for that Reaſon, expect the Kingdom of God, becauſe they are fit and qualified to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to receive it? Our Lord JESUS CHRIST came, he ſays, <hi>to purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good works.</hi> Where is that pure People, where is that acceptable People, where are the People of good works, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of true Holineſs? <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays the holy Scripture, <hi>ſuffer'd for us, leaving us an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

                  <hi>that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> I warrant you we follow our Saviour's Steps in the Cirques, we follow the Steps of our Saviour in the Theatres. Chriſt, no doubt, left us ſuch an Example, whom we read to have wept, but we never read that he laugh'd: for Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Compunction of the Soul, Laughter the Corruption of Diſcipline. And therefore he ſays: <hi>Woe unto you that laugh, for ye ſhall</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. Pray then, what kind of Error, what<note place="margin">When we may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and how far it is lawful.</note> kind of Folly is this? What, cannot we have a conſtant Scene of Merriment and Laughter, unleſs we make our Mirth and Joy become a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100854:98"/>
Sin? What, do we take innocent Jollity to be fruitleſs, nor can't we be merry without being wicked? What Miſchief, or rather, what Madneſs is this? Be merry in God's Name, as exceſſively as you pleaſe; laugh till you are weary, ſo that you do it innocently. What Folly and Frenzy is it, that we do not value any Mirth or Pleaſantry, unleſs it carries in it ſome Affront to our Maker? Nay and the greateſt Affront that poſſibly can be. For in the publick Shews, there is a kind of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing from the Faith and its Pledges, and a mortal Prevarication from the Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For what is the firſt thing that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians profeſs in their Baptiſm to Salvation? What elſe, but that they vow to renounce the Devil, his Pomps, Shews, and Works? And therefore theſe Pomps and Shews, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own Profeſſion, are the works of the Devil. How then, O Chriſtian, do you follow theſe Spectacles after your Baptiſm, which you confeſs to be the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? You have once renounc'd the Devil and all his Shews; ſo that you muſt neceſſarily know, that when you return to theſe Shews, that you do wittingly and knowingly return to the Devil. For you have once renounced them both, and have owned that one is both. If therefore you cloſe with one, you return to both. For you ſay, <hi>I renounce the Devil, his Pomps, Shews and Works.</hi> And what after? You ſay, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jeſus Chriſt his Son,</hi> So that the Devil is in the firſt place renounced, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100854:98"/>
in God: For he who do's not renounce the Devil does not believe in God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoever returns to the Devil, deſerts God: But the Devil is in his Sights and Shews, and therefore, when we return to theſe Shews, we quit our Chriſtian Faith. And thus all the Articles of our Creed are weakned; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that follows after, but what ſtaggers and falters. For if the Foundation do's not hold, nothing that is conſequent to it can ſtand. Tell me then, you Chriſtian, how you can pretend to adhere to the following Parts of your Creed, when you have deſtroy'd the Foundations of it? The Members without the Head are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, and all the Articles depend upon their Principals, which if they fail, all the reſt fall of courſe. For if you take away the Foundation, the reſt remain not all, or if they do, 'tis to no Advantage, becauſe they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth without their Head. If then the Sin of frequenting theſe Sights ſeem little to any one, let him conſider all I have ſaid upon it; and he will ſee, that there is not pleaſure in theſe Sights, but Death. For what is it elſe to loſe the Fountain of Life, but to incur Death? For where the Foundation of the Creed is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Life it ſelf is entirely deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I cannot forbear therefore to return to what I have ſaid often before: What is there like this among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> where are there any Cirque-Games among them, where are their Theatres, where is the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all kind of Impurities, that is, the Deſtruction of our Hopes and Salvation?
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100854:99"/>
And altho' they, as <hi>Pagans,</hi> did make uſe of all theſe, yet their Error would be much leſs cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in the Sight of God; becauſe, although there would be uncleanneſs in the ſeeing of them, yet there would be no Breach of a <note n="c" place="margin">Or Baptiſmal Vow.</note> ſacred Obligation. But as to us, what can we anſwer for our ſelves? We hold the Creed, and yet deſtroy it; we confeſs the Gift of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and at the ſame time deny it. And where is our Chriſtianity this while, who have receiv'd the Sacrament of Salvation to no other purpoſe, but that we might tranſgreſs afterward with greater Sin and Wickedneſs? We prefer Plays before the Churches of God, we deſpiſe the Altars, and honour the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres; We love them all, we reſpect them all: 'Tis only God Almighty who ſeems little to us, in compariſon of them all. For beſide many other Things, which ſhew it, this which I am going to ſay, do's ſufficiently prove it. If at any time it chances, which it often do's, that on the ſame day, there is a Church-Feſtival, and publick Plays, I deſire to ask of every Man's Conſcience, which of the two Places has the greater Congregation of Chriſtians in it, the Seats of the publick Play, or the Court of God, and whether All rather follow the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or the Theatre; and whether they love the Words of the Goſpel more, or thoſe of the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the words of Life, or the words of Death; the words of Chriſt, or the words of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Actor? For on every day of theſe deadly Sports, if there happen to be any Feaſts of the Church, they who call themſelves Chriſtians,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100854:99"/>
do not only not come to Church, but if by chance, not having heard of any ſuch thing, they have come, as ſoon as ever they hear there are Plays, they preſently leave the Church. The Church of God is deſpis'd, that they may haſte to the Play-houſe: The Church is emptied, the Cirque filled. We leave Chriſt on the Altar, that we may feed our Eyes that run a Whoring after the unclean Sights, with the Fornication of thoſe filthy Paſtimes. <note n="*" place="margin">Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Author.</note>

               <p n="8">VIII. But it may be anſwer'd to this, that theſe things are not done in all the Cities of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Right; And I can ſay further, that they are not now acted there, where they have formerly been always acted. For there is no ſuch thing now in the City <note n="d" place="margin">Mentz.</note> 
                  <hi>Moguntia,</hi> but becauſe 'tis ras'd and deſtroy'd. They are not acted at <note n="e" place="margin">Colen.</note> 
                  <hi>Agrippina;</hi> but becauſe 'tis full of Enemies. They are not acted at the Great City of <note n="f" place="margin">Triers.</note> 
                  <hi>Treveris;</hi> but becauſe it has been four times demoliſh'd: And laſtly, they are not acted in very many Cities of <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And therefore woe be to us, and our Impurities; woe be to us and our Iniquities. What hope is there for Chriſtians in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, ſince that theſe Wickedneſſes have not been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, ſince the time they fell under the Power of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi> So that Vice and Impurity are a Sort of quality peculiar to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and are as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100854:100"/>
their very Soul and Nature; for there does Vice particularly reign, whereſoever there are <hi>Romans.</hi> But this is perhaps a heavy and an unjuſt Complaint. 'Twere a heavy one indeed, if 'twere falſe. But how do you ſay; how, not falſe? When, what we have ſpoken of, is now done only in very few <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, and there are a great many which are not at all ſpotted with ſuch Impurities, where, tho' indeed, the Places and Conveniences of their former Error remain; yet they are not at all made uſe of to the ſame purpoſes as formerly? Therefore both Matters are to be conſider'd, that is, how it comes that the Places and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes remain, but the Sports and Paſtimes have ceas'd to be? As to the Places, they are as yet Neſts of Filthineſs, becauſe all Impurity has been there formerly acted. And for the Plays, they are not now acted, becauſe the Miſery and Poverty of the Times is ſo Great, that they cannot be. And therefore what was formerly done, was out of pure Vice, and that it is not now as formerly, is meer Neceſſity. For the Poverty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Lowneſs of the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> Treaſury and Exchequer, cannot allow that extravagant Expences ſhould be every where laviſh'd upon ſuch Trifles. But let them yet ſquander as much as they can, and throw it even to the Dunghill, yet for their Hearts they cannot waſte ſo much as they have done; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not ſo much left for them. For as to the Deſire of our Luſts and impure De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, we could wiſh with our Souls, that we had more, that we might convert more of it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100854:100"/>
to theſe filthy, dirty Pleaſures. And 'tis plain, how much we would ſquander, if we were rich and wealthy, when we are even Beggars, and yet laviſh ſo much. For ſo great is the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Looſneſs of our preſent Manners, that altho' our Poverty has not wherewithal to ſpend, yet the Viciouſneſs of our Tempers would fain ſquander more. We have little Reaſon therefore to flatter our ſelves in this Caſe, by ſaying, that thoſe things are not done in all Cities now, which have been formerly done. For they are not therefore now done in all, becauſe the Cities where they have been formerly acted, are not now in being; and where they have been long acted, they have ſo manag'd it, that they cannot be even where they formerly were; as God himſelf by the Prophet ſpoke to the Sinners, For <hi>the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them:</hi> ſays he, <hi>and it came into his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>mind; ſo that the Lord could no longer bear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evil of your doings, and becauſe of the abominations which you have committed: therefore is your Land a deſolation, and an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and a curſe.</hi> And by theſe Doings it is come to paſs, that the greater part of the <hi>Roman</hi> World ſhould be for a Deſolation, and an Aſtoniſhment, and a Curſe.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And I would to God theſe things had only been done formerly, and that the vicious <hi>Romans,</hi> would ſome time leave off to do them. It may be, as the Scripture ſays, God might have mercy upon our Sins, But we do not act as tho' we deſir'd he ſhould have mercy upon us. For we continually add evil to evil, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100854:101"/>
heap one Sin upon the head of another, and when the greateſt part of us have already pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd; we do what we can that we may periſh all. I deſire to know who ſees another ſlain near him, and is not himſelf afraid? Who ſees his Neighbour's Houſe on fire, and do's not endeavour by all means he can that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlef be not conſum'd in the Flames? We have ſeen not only our Neighbours burn, but have felt the Flames in the greateſt part of our Bodies. But, O ſtrange! What Misfortune is this? We burn, we burn, and yet do not dread the Flames that burns us. For that theſe things, as I ſaid, are not acted every where as formerly, is owing to our Miſery, not out Couduct. And I can eaſily prove it. For put us but in the Condition we formerly were, and you ſhall preſently find all things every where as they were. Nay further, altho' they are not now in reality every where, as far as Men's Wiſhes can make them, they are every where, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> People would willingly have them every where. For when a Man is kept back from doing an evil Thing, meerly out of pure Neceſſity, the very Deſire of doing the Wickedneſs is condemn'd inſtead of the Action. For, as I ſaid, according to that Saying of our<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. 5. v.</hi> 28.</note> Lord, <hi>He who looketh upon a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.</hi> We may underſtand that altho' we do not commit filthy and baſe Actions out of Neceſſity, yet we are condemn'd for the having had an hearty Deſire to the commiſſion of them. But what do I ſpeak of a Deſire,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100854:101"/>
almoſt all commit them, when they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Nay when the Inhabitants of any City whatever come to <hi>Ravenna</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> they make a part of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Cirque, and a part of the People of <hi>Ravenna</hi> in the Theatre. So that by this means, no man by abſence or diſtance can think himſelf excus'd. The filthineſs of the Things makes them all one, who are joyn'd to each other in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thoſe filthy Things. And yet we ſooth our ſelves with the Integrity of our Morals, and flatter our ſelves with the Rarity of Uncleanneſſes. But I affirm, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe infamous contagious Paſtimes which were formerly acted, are now in Being; but that they are acted with much more Guilt than formerly. For then the Parts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> World were entire and flouriſh'd, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Riches crowded the Store-houſes, the Citizens of every City ſwam in Delights and Plenty; the Authority of Religion, amidſt ſo great Abundance of all Things, could ſcarce preſerve a Diſcipline and Order. Inventors of idle Paſtimes were then maintain'd in many places, but then all places were full and crowded: No body thought of the Coſt and Charge of the Publick, becauſe the Expence was never felt. The Publick rather ſought where to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume what its own Store-houſes could ſcarce contain. And ſo the heap of Riches, which exceeded almoſt all Meaſure, overflowed upon thoſe Trifles. But now what can be ſaid? Our former Plenty is departed. Times and Eſtates are alter'd, and we are became miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100854:102"/>
poor, and yet we do not ceaſe to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling. And when Poverty uſed to cure the greateſt Prodigals and Spend-thrifts; ſo that as ſoon as ever they leave off to be rich, they forthwith forſake their Vices; 'tis only we that are a new ſort of Spendthrifts and Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hells, whom Riches has forſaken, and yet our Wickedneſs remains. So that we have not, like other Men, the Occaſions of our Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in Temptations, but in our own hearts; and our own inward Man is the Cauſe of all our Naughtineſs; we are not to be amended by the taking away of our Eſtates, ſince we ſin out of pure Love and Affection to the evil Things themſelves.</p>

But I give this Advertiſement before I begin, <hi>That no Fault whatever ſeem little to any one, by which the Great God of Heaven is offended.</hi> For if it is not by any Means permitted to any one to diſhonour a Noble and Illuſtrious Perſon, and if any one does abuſe ſueh a one, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Tryal for the ſame, and to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally condemn'd for the Affront; how much greater a Crime is it for any one to pretend to offer an Affront to his Maker? For the Fault does always riſe in proportion to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Party who bears the Abuſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſary by how much the greater the Perſon is who ſuffers the Injury, by ſo much the greater is his Fault who offers it.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100854:102"/>
And hence it is that we read in the Law, that<note place="margin">Exod. 31. Numb. 2. &amp; 2.</note> even thoſe who ſeem to have done only ſome ſmall Matters againſt the Divine Command, were yet moſt ſeverely puniſh'd. That we might underſtand from thence, that nothing relating to God ought to be eſteem'd light. For even that which ſeem'd to be little, as to the Fault, the Affront thereby offer'd to God made very great. But what did <hi>

Yet while he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it, he was ſmitten dead, not, as it ſhould ſeem that in any particular he had done any thing out of an obſtinate or undutiful Heart, but by his over-officiouſneſs, he became undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, becauſe he preſum'd to do that, which he had no Command for.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100854:103"/>
for the obſervance of his Law, to curb their rebellious Deſires, to the intent that all the People might more eaſily acknowledge, how much they ought to avoid the Things which God had forbidden in the holy Scriptures, when they found they receiv'd ſo much Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by doing what he had not as yet forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">

What elſe ſhould it be but to ſhew, that nothing ought to be eſteem'd light, by which God is offended. For I ſpeak of theſe publick Plays, the Mockery's of our Hope, and the Cheats of our Lives. For whilſt we divert our ſelves in the Theatres and Cirques, we periſh, according to that Saying of the Holy Scripture; <hi>It is a Sport to a Pool to do miſchief.</hi> And ſo we in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100854:103"/>
moſt peſtilent and pernicious. For ſince there are two the greateſt of Evils, that is, if a Man either deſtroy himſelf, or offend God, both theſe are done in the Publick Plays. For the eternal Salvation of Chriſtian People is there deſtroy'd by their ſcandalous Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and the Majeſty of God prophan'd by their ſacrilegious Superſtitions: For there is no doubt but they offend God, ſince they are conſecrated to Idols. For <hi>Minerva</hi> is worſhip'd and honour'd in their places for Exerciſe. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the Theatres; <hi>Neptune</hi> in the Cirques, <hi>Mars</hi> in the <note n="c" place="margin">Of the Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre.</note> Sands, <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-places; and ſo according to the Quality of their Patrons, is the Superſtition of the Worſhip. Whatever uncleanneſſes can be thought of, are exercis'd in the Theatres, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Luxury can be nam'd in the wreſtling places; all manner of exceſs in the Cirques, and all manner of frenzy among the Crouds of Spectators. In one place there is Immodeſty, in another Laſciviouſneſs, in another Madneſs, and the Devil in them all; nay all the Devils of Hell are in every one of the Places of theſe Paſtimes. For they preſide over the Places dedicated to their Worſhip, So that in theſe ſort of Shews and Sights, there are not only Enticements and Temptations, not only Vice and Naughtineſs; For 'tis a kind of Sacrilege for a Chriſtian Man to be joyn'd to ſuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, becauſe he communicates with their Worſhip, with whoſe Paſtime he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. Which altho' it be always heineus, yet it is then much more intolerable, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100854:104"/>
our ordinary Courſe of Life, either our Adverſity or Proſperity makes this more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. For in our Adverſity God is the more to be reconcil'd, and in our Proſperity to be leſs offended; when he is Wrath, he ought to be pacified, and ſhould not be offended when he is appeas'd; For Adverſity comes upon us by God's Wrath, and Proſperity by his Favour. But we do all the quite contrary. You ask, it may be, how? Obſerve, and I'll tell you. And in the firſt place, if God Almighty is at any time of his own free Mercy intreated (for we never live ſo at any time, as that we deſerve to be pleaded for;) but if, as I ſaid, being intreated by Himſelf, he gives us peaceful Times, Increaſe and Plenty of all Things; Quietneſs, Riches, and Abundance, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Wiſhes or Deſires, we are only made worſe by ſuch a Series of Proſperity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſuch Lewdneſs and Inſolence in our Morals, that we altogether forget both God and our ſelves. And when the Apoſtle ſays, That the Advantage of ſuch Peace grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by God, conſiſts in this, <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> We uſe the Eaſe granted us by<note place="margin">

ſince we make no better uſe of them, but turn that very thing into an occaſion of Vice, which he deſign'd for an Inducement to Vertue and good Works.

When the Arms of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> were ſounding round the Walls of <hi>Cirta</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Chriſtians of <hi>Carthage,</hi> were running mad in the Cirques, and rioting in the Theatres. Whilſt the Throats of ſome were cut without doors, others were playing the Whores and Rogues within. Part of the People without doors were made Priſoners by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and part within were made Priſoners by their Luſts: and which of the two had the harder Fortune is uncertain. They who are without, were only made Captives in their Bodies; but they who were within were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivated in their Souls; And of two ſo great Evils, as I ſuppoſe, it is much eaſier for a Chriſtian to bear the Captivity of his Body, than that of his Soul, according to that which our Saviour ſays in the Goſpel, That the Loſs<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.</note> of Souls is much greater Damage than that of the Body's. Can we think that the People
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100854:105"/>
were not captivated in their Souls, who could rejoyce after that manner in the Captivity of their Burthen? Were not their Hearts and Senſes captivated, who amidſt the Tortures of their Countrymen could be merry, who did not perceive that they themſelves were ſtabb'd in the Murder of their Friends, and that they died in the Death of their Neighbours? There was a Great Noiſe, as I may ſo ſay, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without the Walls, of Battle, and of Paſtimes; the Cry of thoſe that died, and thoſe that revell'd, was confounded; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Groans of thoſe who fell in the Battle, could not eaſily be diſcern'd from the Noiſe of thoſe, who hollow'd in the Cirque. And by doing all theſe things, what elſe could ſuch a baſe People mean, but that ſeeing, that God thought not fit to deſtroy them at preſent, yet they would even demand their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from him.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But why do I ſpeak of Things ſo far off, and done in quite another Part of the World, when to my own Knowledge in my own Country, and in the Cities of <hi>Gaul,</hi> almoſt all the Great Men became much worſe by their Calamities. For I my ſelf have ſeen ſeveral Inhahitants of <hi>Treveris,</hi> Men of Birth, and of<note place="margin">Triers.</note> Preferments; but now pillaged and deſpoil'd of all, who were yet leſs ſhatter'd in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, than they were in their Morals. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' in their plunder'd and ſtripp'd Condition, they had ſome ſmall Remnant of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Yet they had not one Rag of Morality. So that they were greater Foes to themſelves
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100854:106"/>
than their foreign Enemies were, for altho' they were undone by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yet they were much more undone by themſelves. It is diſmal to relate what I have ſeen; worſhipful old Gentlemen, decrepid Chriſtians, juſt when the City was falling into the Enemies hands, indulging themſelves in Gluttony and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs. And what ſhall I blame Chiefly in this Matter? That they were Worſhipful, that they were old Men, that they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or that they were in danger? For, who would ever think ſuch a thing could be done, in the greateſt ſecurity by old Men, or in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by young ones, or ever by Cbriſtians? They lay at their Feaſts, having forgot their Honour, forgot their Years, forgot their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and forgot their Reputation; the Chief of the City ſtuffed with Meat, diſſolv'd in Drunkenneſs; Bawling outragiouſly, Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling madly, quite out of their Senſes; but conſidering that they are almoſt always in that pickle, I ſhould have ſaid, being altogether in their Senſes. But matters being thus, that is more, which I am now going to ſay, that the utter Deſtruction of the Cities put no end to theſe Debaucheries. For the richeſt City of <hi>Gaul</hi> was four times taken: 'Tis eaſy to gueſs which I mean. One would have thought the<note place="margin">Triers.</note> firſt taking might have caus'd a Reformation in it, that the renewing of its Faults might not have renew'd its Deſtruction. But to be ſhort, that which I now ſay is, ſcarce to be credited. The very continuance of their Calamities there, was the encreaſing of their Crimes.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100854:106"/>
And, as old Stories tell of that Monſter of a<note place="margin">Hydra.</note> Serpent, who encreaſed by being wounded, ſo in this moſt Famous City of <hi>Gaul,</hi> their Wickedneſſes encreaſed by that very Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which kept them back from ſinning: So that you would think the chaſtiſing of their Crimes were the original of their Vices. And what ſhould I ſay more? By the daily encreaſe of hourly growing Ills, they are come to that paſs, that you may eafily find that City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Inhabitant, than almoſt any Inhabitant in it without a Crime. This is the condition of that City. What is there done in <note n="a" place="margin">Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina <hi>or</hi> Colen.</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not far off, but almoſt as Magnificent as the other? Is not there likewiſe the ſame Ruine of Eſtates and Morals? For beſide all the reſt, when all things were fallen to pieces by thoſe two eſpecial and general Evils, Covetouſneſs and Drunkenneſs, at laſt, by their greedy Deſire of Wine, they came to that paſs, that the Chief of the City had not then riſen from their Banqueting, even when the Enemy had entred the Town. So that, I verily believe, God had a mind to ſhew them plainly the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Deſtruction, when they were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that very Thing at the Minute of their Ruine, which had been the Occaſion of their utter Perdition. I ſaw there many lamentable Sights, no manner of difference between Boys and old Men: The ſame idle Jeſting, the ſame Levity. All things jumbled together, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Tippling, and Deſtruction. All did every thing alike, they play'd, got drunk, and ſo were knock'd on the Head. Old men, and of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100854:107"/>
Reputation play'd the Wantons in their Feaſts, they had ſcarce ſtrength to live, and yet were ſtout and luſty at the Bottle; infirm in their Walking, but robuſt in their Drinking: Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in their common gate, yet very nimble at Dancing. In ſhort; By what I have ſaid, 'tis plain they are come to this, that the Saying of the Son of <hi>Syrak; Holy writ</hi> is fulfilled in them:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ. 19. v.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Wine and Women make men fall away from God.</hi> For while they drink, play, whore, and run mad, they begin to deny Chriſt; And we admire after all this, that ſuch People loſe their Eſtates, who have ſo long before loſt their Senſes. Let no one then think that 'tis only the City which is brought to ruine. For where ſuch things as I have mention'd are acted, there the Inhabitants have periſh'd, even long before they are deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. I have even now ſpoke of the Grand Cities. How far'd it with the other Cities in other Parts of <hi>Gaul?</hi> Have not they periſh'd by the like Crimes of their Inhabitants? For their Iniquities preſs'd them ſo hard, that they never fear'd the Danger. They were ſenſible before-hand of their Captivity, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreaded it. The apprehenſion of danger was taken from them, leſt they ſhould fence againſt it. So that when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were even in Sight, the People had not fear upon them, nor ever guarded the Cities. So great was the Blindneſs of their Minds, or rather of their Sins, that when 'tis certain not one of them was willing to die, yet not one of them did any thing to prevent his own Deſtruction,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100854:107"/>
They were altogether Careleſneſs and Lazineſs it ſelf, Negligence and Gluttony; Drunkenneſs and Drowzineſs had poſſeſs'd them All, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the Scripture ſays of ſuch Men; <hi>that a deep ſleep from the Lord was fallen upon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam. 26. v.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>them.</hi> The deep ſleep was laid upon them, that their Deſtruction might follow. For when, as it is written, a Sinner having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen. 15. v.</hi> 16.</note> his Iniquities, deſerves to periſh, all fore-ſight is taken from him, leſt by the help of that, he ſhould eſcape. But enough on this head. For, I ſuppoſe, I have ſufficiently prov'd what I undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> that even in the utmoſt Danger, the Debaucheries of the Citizens never ceas'd, to the very Minute of the Deſtruction of the Cities.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. It may be ſuch things as theſe have been, but now they are not, or will ceaſe ever to be. And if any either City or Province is at this day either viſited with Plagues from Heaven, or laid waſte by an Enemy, it is Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, Converted and Amended, and it is not the Temper of all the <hi>Romans</hi> in general ſooner to Periſh, than be reform'd, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leave off Being, than not be in their Sins. That may eaſily be ſeen in the three Succeſſive Deſtructions of the greateſt <note n="e" place="margin">Triers.</note> City of <hi>Gaul:</hi> when all the City was but as one Grave, their Evils increaſing even after their Ruin. For thoſe whom the Enemy had not deſtroy'd in its overthrow, Miſery deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards. And that which had eſcap'd Death in the taking of it, cou'd not afterwards ſurvive the diſtreſs. For ſome died lingring
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100854:108"/>
Deaths of deep Wounds. Others after the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town, were tortur'd and burn'd by the Enemy; Some died of Famine, others of Nakedneſs, ſome waſted away, and others were Starv'd. So they all came to the ſame Stage of Death by different ways of dying. And in ſhort, Other Cities were Annoyed by the Ruine of this One. For the Naked dead Bodies of both Sexes, lay ſcatter'd abroad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, I my ſelf have ſeen, and endur'd it, defiling the Eyes of the City, torn piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, and devour'd by Birds and Dogs. The infectious ſtanch of the Dead, caus'd a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence among the Living. Death was exhaled from Death: So that they who were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Ruine of the foreſaid City, bore the Misfortunes of its Deſtruction. And what I pray you followed after all this? Why ſuch a Madneſs, as is not eaſily to be thought of.

O that I had in this Place Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick equal to the Subject, to purſue the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it ſufficiently, that the Complaint might have as great a ſting in it, as the Cauſe has Sorrow! For who can ſay what is moſt to be blamed in the Premiſes, whether Irreligion, Folly, Luxury or Madneſs? Since they are all in them. For what can be more Irreligious than to deſire any thing to affront our Maker? Or more Fooliſh than not to conſider what it is you deſire? Or what abandon'd Luxury is it to deſire Rioting and Revelling in a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100854:108"/>
time of Mourning? Or what greater Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can there be than to be in Miſery, and not to be the leaſt ſenſible of it. Altho' in this whole Matter, nothing is leſs to be blam'd than the Madneſs of it; for where the Sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Frenzy, there the Will is in no Fault. Would you Men of <hi>Treveris,</hi> then fain have Cirque-Games, and this after you have been Plunder'd, and Ruin'd, after Blood and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after Torments and Captivity, and ſo many Overthrows of your Conquer'd City? What can be more ſad than this Folly, and more lamentable than this Madneſs? I confeſs, I thought you were ſufficiently miſerable, when your City was deſtroy'd; but now I ſee you are much more miſerable, ſince you deſire theſe wicked Shews. I thought before truly, that you had only loſt your Goods and Eſtates, when you loſt your Town; I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that you had loſt your Senſes and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding likewiſe. You deſire Theatres then, and Petition for a Cirque from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For what State, I beſeech you; for what People, for what City? For one that is burnt and deſtroy'd, for a People that are captivated and murder'd, who are either loſt, or in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; of whom, if any thing remains, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Miſery; who are either dejected with Sorrow, exhauſted with Tears, or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Loſs of Friends, among whom you can ſcarce tell who had the harder Fortune, thoſe who were kill'd, or thoſe who ſurvive. For the Miſeries of thoſe who remain, are ſo Great, that they exceed the Infelicity of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100854:109"/>
Dead. You City of <hi>Treveris</hi> then, petition for publick Paſtimes? Pray where will you play 'em? What, upon the Graves and Aſhes, upon the Blood and Bones of the Slain? For what part of the City is there, that has not ſome of them? Where is not Blood ſhed, where are not Bodies ſcatter'd, where are not the mangl'd Limbs of the Slain? There are every where ſigns of a Vanquiſh'd City. the Horror of Captivity, and the Image of Death. The miſerable Reliques of the People are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Graves of their Dead; and yet you ask for the Paſtimes of the Cirques? The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is all Sooty with its late Burning, and you would put on the Face of Mirth? Every thing in it is ſorrowful; but you are joyful. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all this, you provoke God by theſe moſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Fopperies, and ſtir up His Diſpleaſure by theſe worſt of Superſtitions. I do not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder, I do not any longer admire, that ſo many Evils have fallen upon you; for ſince you have not been amended by three Ruines, I think, you very well deſerv'd to feel the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See p.</hi> 27.</note> Fourth.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. I have drawn out this Matter the<note place="margin">How God ſometimes chaſtiſes us with Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and ſometimes he indulges us with Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Eaſe.</note> longer, that I might ſhew, that all the Evils we endure, do not come upon us by the Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs or Neglect of God; but that we bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them by His Juſtice, by His Judgment, by His moſt righteous Diſpenſation, and moſt juſtly Retribution; and that there is not any one Part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or of any thing that bears that Name, how ſeverely ſoever they have been puniſh'd from above, that have ever been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100854:109"/>
by it. So that we do not by any means merit the Enjoyment of Proſperity, becauſe we are not made better by Adverſity. And yet as unworthy as we are, we ſometimes receive Good Things: For our Good God, like a moſt tender Father, altho' he ſuffers us ſometimes to be humbled for our Iniquities, yet he does not leave us long under the Affliction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſhew His Government, he does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Chaſtiſe us with Hardſhips; and other times again to ſhew His Tenderneſs, he Indulges us with Tranquility and Eaſe. For as the beſt and moſt Skilful Phyſicians ſuit different Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to different Diſtempers, and Cure ſome by Sweet Medicines, and others by Bitter; reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome by Cauſticks and Burning, and others by gentle emollient Applications; to ſome they uſe Cutting and Scarifying, and on others pour the ſmootheſt, ſofteſt Oyl, and yet it is but the ſame Health that is procur'd by all theſe Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Methods: Even ſo our God, when ever he uſes Severity towards us, Cures us, as it were, by Cauſticks and Scarifying, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes us again with Eaſe and Proſperity, he Comforts us, as it were, with Oyl and emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Medicines. For His Deſign is to bring us to the ſame Health and Welfare by the help of different Remedies. Good Words are us'd ſometimes to mend the worſt of Servants, whom Correction will do no good upon; and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have made them ſubmit to their Maſters, when Stripes wou'd never do it. So Sugar-Plums and fair Words will bring thoſe little, teſty, peeviſh Brats under Government, who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100854:110"/>
would never ſubmit to Threats and the Rod. By which we may underſtand, that we are worſe than the worſt of Servants, and more fooliſh than the fillieſt Children; ſince Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not amend us, as it does bad Servants, nor fair Words change us, as they do young Children.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. And now I think I have ſufficiently prov'd that no Part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amended by the Puniſhments inflicted on them. It remains that I ſhew likewiſe, that they have not been reform'd by God's Bounty and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs. But what are the Bounty and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs of God? What ſhould they be, but our Peace and our Quiet, and a Proſperous Tranquility, the Foundations of all our other Joys and Satisfactions. But, ſince the Matter requires it, I ſhall mention ſomewhat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. As oft then, as we are in Fear, in Straits, or Dangers; when either our Cities are beſieg'd by the Enemies, or our Provinces waſted by Plunder, or any Parts of the Common-wealth are in Trouble and Diſtreſs, and we Pray to Heaven for Aſſiſtance; if by the Divine Help and Pity, the Cities are ſav'd, or the plundring ended, or the Enemies routed, and all Fear by the Favour of Heaven remov'd, what is it that we do after all this? I preſume we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recompenſe to our Lord God the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we have receiv'd from him by Worſhip, Honour and Reverence. For that follows of Courſe, 'tis but what is Common among all Mankind, that we ſhould return Thanks to thoſe who have lent us Favours, and give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100854:110"/>
to thoſe who have formerly preſented us. So then, it may be, we do; and dealing with our God at leaſt after the returns uſed among Men, when we receive Good Things from Him, we return Good Things to Him. We haſte im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Houſe of God, proſtrate our ſelves on the Ground, Pray to Him with Joy and Tears together, we Adorn the Sacred Building with our Preſents, and load the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars with our Offerings; and becauſe purely by His Favour we our ſelves keep Holy-day, we put the Church it ſelf in the ſame chearful Dreſs; or at leaſt, which is as pleaſing to Him, we renounce our former Sins, we ſlay the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Good Works, and for our new Joy, Offer the Sacrifices of our new Converſation; we proclaim a Holy War againſt all manner of Uncleanneſs, we ſhun the Madneſs of the Cirques, we Abominate the filthineſs of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres, we Vow a New Life to our Lord; and for the obtaining of His perpetual Protection, we Sacrifice our ſelves to God.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Seeing then, that what I have ſaid ought to be done for freſh Favours receiv'd from God, let us ſee what is done. They haſt forth with to the Plays, they fly to their Follies and Madneſſes; all the people are diſperſed in the Theatres, and behave themſelves like Madmen in the Cirques. He beſtows good things on us, in order to make us good. We on the contrary, as oft as we receive thoſe Good Things, add to the Summ of our Wickedneſſes. He by His loving-kindneſs calls us to Virtue; we run headlong into Vice. He by His Favours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100854:111"/>
us to Compunction; but we run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into Debauchery. He calls us to Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we run headlong into Uncleanneſs. We anſwer the Divine Bounty very finely. We do both acknowledge and Honour his Gifts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delicately; who for as many Benefits as we receive from him, 'take care to repay him with ſo many Injuries. It may be, this is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to God, or there may be ſome greater; or is there need of many and Great Ones? But ſince by an inveterate Contagion of all manner of Wickedneſſes, we cannot now be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not Vicious, than by ceaſing altogether to be; I deſire to know, what hope there is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Goodneſs from us? They who ſin out of ignorance are reform'd, when they know their Error. They who have no Religion, when they Change their Profeſſion, begin likewiſe to Change their Manners. Laſtly, as I have ſaid, they who are vicious by over-much Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eaſe, or leave off being Rake-hells, when they have loſt their Eaſe. We offend neither out of Ignorance, nor for want of Religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we corrupted by Proſperity and Eaſe. But all the quite contrary. We have known the true Religion, and are not excus'd by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; have not the Peace and Riches of the former Times; All things that have been, are either taken away or chang'd, nothing has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd with us, but our Vices. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the former Peace and Proſperity left us, unleſs the Crimes of them, which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the loſs even of that Proſperity. For where are the former Riches and Honours of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100854:111"/>
the <hi>Romans?</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were formerly moſt ſtrong, but now they have loſt their Strength. The Antient <hi>Romans</hi> were dreaded, and now we ſtand in fear. Foreigners paid them Tribute, and now we pay Taxes to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners: Our Enemies ſell us, even the very uſe of the Light. Our Safety and Being is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Merchandize. O Miſerable Wretches, to what a paſs are we Come! And yet we give Thanks to and Addreſs thoſe very Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, from whom we purchaſe, even our ſelves at a Price. Can any thing be more Abject and Miſerable than we? And do we think we Live after this, when even our Life coſts us ſo much? Beſide all this, we make our ſelves ridiculous, the vaſt Summs we pay, we call free Gifts. We call that a Gift, which is a Price, and a Price of the hardeſt and moſt Miſerable Condition. For all Captives, when they are once deliver'd, enjoy their Liberty: We are always deliver'd, and yet are never free. Theſe Foreigners deal by us juſt like thoſe Maſters who let out thoſe Slaves for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Wages, for whom they have no Neceſſity themſelves. Even ſo, we, in like Manner are never free from the Duties we pay: But ſtill pay them the Acknowledgments of our Slavery, that ſo we may never leave off paying them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHen in the Concluſion of the Book,<note place="margin">How In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible we are and rather worſe with Gods Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements.</note> which I have juſt now finiſh'd, I mention'd ſomewhat of the Weakneſs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the <hi>Romans,</hi> I may be thought to have ſaid, what makes againſt the Subject I am handling. For I am ſenſible, that it may in this place be objected, That from hence there is a manifeſt Proof, that God do's not regard Humane Affairs: Becauſe, when the <hi>Romans</hi> were formerly <hi>Pagans,</hi> they both conquer'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100854:112"/>
and rul'd; but now they are become Chriſtians, they are both Conquer'd, and made Slaves of. What I have ſaid long ſince, of almoſt all the <hi>Pagans,</hi> might be a ſufficient Confutation of this Obiection; that is, that they ſin more heinouſly, who knowingly tranſgreſs the Law of God, than they who tranſgreſs out of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. However, with God's Permiſſion, when I come to that Part of my Task, where ſomething is to be ſaid of the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhall with His Aſſiſtance plainly ſhew, that God's Favour toward them then was as juſt, as His Severity now toward us is righteous; and that it was as meet that God ſhould then, by His Aſſiſtance, exalt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it is fitting, that we now ſhould be chaſtis'd; And I wiſh heartily we were any thing the better for the Chaſtiſement. But what is more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lamentable, that there is no Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows it. Our Lord would cure us by His Puniſhments, but the Cure do's not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Remedies. What a mighty Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is this? The larger and leſſer Cattle are cured by Inciſion; and the putrified Bowels of Mules, Aſſes and Hogs, when they are burnt by cauteriſing, acknowledge the Benefit of the Healing fire, and preſently, as ſoon as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted part is either burnt or cut off, live Fleſh ſucceeds in the room of that which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was dead. We are both burnt and ſlaſh'd, but are not heal'd, neither by Scarifying nor Cauſticks: Nay, which is harder, are made worſe by the very Cure. And therefore that is deſervedly fallen upon us, which uſes to happen to all ſorts
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100854:113"/>
of Cattle, that are ſeis'd with incurable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. For in all parts of the World, becauſe we are not amended by the Healing Remedies deſign'd us, we are brought to our End by Death and Deſtruction. For obſerve, that I may not repeat what I have already ſaid long before; what an odd Thing is that which I mention'd juſt now, that we are at the ſame time, both Miſerable and Debauch'd? For granting, that theſe are the Vices of happy People (tho' no one Man can be both wicked and happy; for where there is not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac'd Honeſty, there is no true Felicity) but yet, as I ſaid before, granting, that theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are the Effects of Peace, of Plenty, and Security. How, I beſeech you, come they to be there, where there is neither Peace nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity? For in almoſt all the <hi>Roman</hi> World, there is no Peace nor Security. Why are our Vices the only durable Things? Who, I pray you, can bear to ſee Laſciviouſneſs in a Man<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ 25. v.</hi> 2.</note> in want? For Luxury in Poverty is much more Criminal; and for a Man in Miſery to play the Fool, muſt needs increaſe the Cenſure. All the <hi>Roman</hi> World is both Miſerable and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xurious. Who, I deſire to know, is poor, and yet ſpends his Time in Trifles; who, when he expects Captivity, thinks of the Cirque, who is under the apprehenſion of Death, and yet is merry? Yet we play under the very Dread of Captivity, and having the Fear of Death upon us, burſt into Laughter. You would think all the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſatiated with the Herbs of <note n="*" place="margin">A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial ſaying, for a fooliſh laughing with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the end.</note> 
                  <hi>Sardinia,</hi> They die Laughing.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100854:113"/>
And therefore, almoſt in all Parts of the World, Tears follow our Laughter; and even at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that Saying of our Lord is come upon us: <hi>Woe unto you that laugh, for you ſhall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">II. But it may be, ſince I have ſpoken ſo<note place="margin">Of Gods Goodneſs in deſiring nothing that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heavy or burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar favour's conferred upon us.</note> long of the publick Sports and Uncleanneſſes, ſome one may be apt to think, that we are worſe than the <hi>Barbarians</hi> only in this, becauſe they do no ſuch things, and 'tis only we that do them; but as to the wickedneſs of Carnal Luſts, and the filth of Abominable Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are not by any means ſo Bad. Let us, if you pleaſe, compare the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Particular with the other People. And really, I cannot tell whether they can be more rightly compar'd to any than to thoſe, whom God having plac'd, in the very heart of the Commonwealth, has made Lords and Maſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soil. But altho' nothing can be argu'd of the Judgment of God; yet ſeeing he has taken away from us a great Part of our Poſſeſſions, and given them to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> let us conſider whether, what he has taken from us, and given to them, he can be thought to have done by a juſt Judgment. Every one knows, that the <hi>Aquitanes,</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of what is now call'd <hi>Gaſcoine</hi> and <hi>Guien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem-Populi,</hi> had the very Marrow of almoſt all <hi>Gaul,</hi> and the Breaſts of all its Plenty; and not only of Plenty, but of what is ſometimes preferr'd before it, of Delight, Pleaſure, and<note place="margin">(*) People of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock</hi> and <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coine.</hi>
                  </note> Beauty. The whole Country there was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with Vineyards, and curious flowry Meads, chequer'd with various Tillage, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100854:114"/>
with Orchards, or the pleaſanteſt Groves, water'd with Fountains, or flow'd between by Rivers, or cover'd all over with Harveſts plenty; ſo that the Poſſeſſors and Owners of that Country ſeem'd not ſo much to enjoy that Portion of the Soil, as the very Reſemblance of Paradiſe. And what after all this? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they ought to be more dutiful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, whom he had thus in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner enrich'd with ſuch an Abundance of His Favours. For what is more rational and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than that they whom God by His Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſeem'd particularly willing to oblige, ſhould likewiſe in an eſpecial manner, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe him by Honour and religious Service; eſpecially conſidering, that God, requires nothing that is heavy or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome from us. God do's not call us to the Plow or the Spade; not to Till the Earth, nor to Dig and Delve in the Vineyard; nor do's he require ſo much of us, as we do from our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: For what ſays he? <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11. v. 28, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>you reſt. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls. For my yoke is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us.</note> 
                  <hi>eaſie, and my burden is light.</hi> Our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do's not invite us to Labour, but to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. For what does he require of us, what does he command us to perform, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Faith, Chaſtity, Humility, Sobriety, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Holineſs; all which do not burden, but beautifie us? And not only ſo, but they do therefore adorn this preſent Life, that they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100854:114"/>
may much more adorn that which is to come. O the Goodneſs, Loving-kindeſs, and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Mercy of God, who gives us in this preſent Life the Bleſſing of Religion for that very End, that he may hereafter reward the very Things that he gave us! Such certainly, without all queſtion, the <hi>Aquitanes</hi> ought to have been. And truly, as I ſaid, in a more eſpecial manner, becauſe they receiv'd more eſpecial Favours from the hand of God. But what after all theſe? What follow'd? What, but every thing the quite contrary? For as they were the richeſt in all <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſo they were the moſt Vicious. For there was no where greater Voluptuouſneſs, no where lewder Lives, nor no where more corrupt Diſcipline. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they made the Lord for His heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that as much as He by His loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, endeavour'd to draw them to him, that he might have mercy upon them; ſo much on the other hand by their deteſtable Actions, they labour'd to exaſperate Him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But it may be, this is falſe, and is rather<note place="margin">Of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Aquitanes.</note> ſpoken invidiouſly, than truly? I ſhall not make uſe of any far-fetch'd Proof, as Orators and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Cauſes are us'd to do, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to juſtify it only ſome few, and thoſe ſtrangers, and not legal Witneſſes. I will only ask the Parties, who have done the Fact. I have told an untruth, if they deny it. For they confeſs it, and which is worſe, they own it ſo, as not to ſhew the leaſt Sorrow in the Confeſſion. For they have the ſame Mind now in the Confeſſing it, as they had before
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100854:115"/>
in the Acting it. As then they were not aſhamed to commit the Wickedneſs, ſo neither now do they in the leaſt repent, that they had done thoſe Wicked things. Excepting however, ſome very few Holy and Eminent Men, who, as one of their Number ſays—<hi>Redeem'd their Crimes by ſcattering their Coin</hi>—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, I ſay, thoſe I ſpeak of, whom in that Univerſal Stanch and Filth of Vices, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only to have been guilty of the leſſer Crimes, ſince they deſerv'd to be reform'd by Heaven. For he does not in every Reſpect offend his Lord, for whóm Mercy is reſerved. And in ſhort, I am of Opinion that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways his Eye upon God in the midſt of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, who could obtain the Bleſſing from Him, that he might continue no longer in it. But the reſt, and Moſt, and Richeſt, were almoſt all the ſame; their Guts were almoſt one bottomleſs Pit: And all their Lives one continued Brothel-houſe. But what do I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Brothel-houſes? I take the Bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to be much leſs faulty. For the Harlots who are there, never knew the Bond of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and ſo they do not pollute what they never knew. They do indeed deſerve to be puniſh'd for the Sin of Unchaſtity, but yet they are not guilty of the ſin of Adultery. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, there are not many Brothels, and there are very few Queans, who have damn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that curſed way of Living. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Aquitanes,</hi> what City was there in the Richeſt and Nobleſt part of it, which was not like a perfect Stews? Where was there a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100854:115"/>
Rich Man of Power, who did not live in the filth of Luſts? Who did not plunge himſelf in the naſty ſtinking Jaques? Who was true to his Bed? Nay, as far as lying with them goes, who has not reduc'd his Wife into the Number of his Maid-ſervants, and debaſed the Sacred Obligation of holy Wedlock, ſo far, that no one in the Family ſeems Meaner in the Husbands Eyes, than ſhe who was Chief by the Honour of her Marriage?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But perhaps ſome one or other thinks, that it was not ſo bad to the full, as I repreſent it, for that the Miſtreſſes of the Family had their Right there, and that they poſſes'd all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Power due to Miſtreſſes. Many of them truly, had their Governing Power entire, but ſcarce one of them their Bed undefil'd. And we are not now enquiring what is the Power of the Women, but of the Baſeneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality of the Men. Altho', neither can Pſay that That Miſtreſs of the Family has her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entire there; becauſe, whoever ſhe be, that has not her Matrimonial Dues ſafe and unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, neither has ſhe her Power entire. For that Miſtreſs of the Houſe is at very little diſtance from the meaneſt of her Servants, where the Maſter of the Family is the Husband of the Maids. But who of the Wealthy <hi>Aquitans,</hi> was not this? Whom have not their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Maid-ſervants rightly call'd either their Adulterer or their Husband? For <hi>they were,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem. 5. v.</hi> 8.</note> as the Prophet ſays, <hi>As fed Horſes, every one neigh'd after his Neighbours Wife.</hi> And they of whom we thus read in the Scripture, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100854:116"/>
offended with a much leſs Crime, and a much leſs Number and Repetition of them. But theſe, like true fed Horſes, did not neigh after a few, but after all their little Slaves, that is, after their own Herds; and like thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, who are call'd the Husbands of the Flock,<note place="margin">Goats.</note> rambling in the frenzy of boyling Luſt, they fly upon the firſt Female the burning Fury of their Lewdneſs leads them to. Here ſeeing Matters are thus, I would ask of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon, what ſort of Families does he think were there, when they had ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? How great muſt the Corruption of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Servants be, where that of the Maſter is ſo large? For when the Head is Diſtemper'd, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Body is ſound; nor does any one Limb perform its Office, when the Principal is out of order. For in his Family the Maſter is, as it were, the Head of the Body, and his Life is the Rule which all the others live by. And this is the Miſchief in this Affair, that all do more willingly follow the worſe Examples, and ill Inſtruction will ſooner ſpoil thoſe who are Good, than good Advice Reform thoſe who are Bad. But beſides, ſeeing that the Good and Honeſt Maſters of Families, cannot make their Servants Good, what a lamentable. Condition muſt thoſe Families be in, where the Maſters are the Patterns of Lewdneſs? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' in this Caſe there was not only bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but a ſort of Force and Neceſſity; becauſe the Maid-ſervants were forc'd to comply with their moſt unchaſte Lords againſt their Will, and the Luſt of the Maſter neceſſitated the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100854:116"/>
By which we may ſee how great the filth and naſtineſs of their Luſts were, that it was not poſſible for the Women, tho' they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd it, to live Chaſte under ſuch lewd Maſters.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But it may be, this is very difficult to be prov'd, and there are no footſteps at all leſt of the paſt Filthineſſes and Villanies. Nay there are even now many of them, altho' they have loſt their Country, and in compariſon of their former Plenty, live Poorly, yet are even worſe than they were before. They are worſe more ways than one, becauſe altho' they do the ſame things they formerly did, yet they are ſo much the worſe in this, that they do not leave off their ſinning. For if their preſent Wickedneſſes are not greater in their kind, yet they are more; and for that reaſon tho' they do not increaſe in the newneſs of their Crimes, they ſufficiently add to the Number. Add to this, that they do theſe things in old Age, and now they are Poor: For both are an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crime. Becauſe it is leſs ſtrange to ſee Young men and Rich men Sin. But what Hope or Remedy is there for them, who are not reclaim'd from their habitual Impurities, neither by Miſery and want, nor by the Concluſion of their Lives. For ſuppoſe that an Idle preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of long Life, or the hope of repenting ſome time or other, does Comfort ſome; Is it not altogether Monſtrous, that any ſhould be vicious, even at the time of Death? Things being thus, Is there any thing more can be ſaid? Yes, 'tis a further Addition, that many do theſe Things at this day, in the midſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100854:117"/>
of the Enemies, and being Captives in daily Danger and Fear: and when by reaſon of their moſt impure Lives, they were deliver'd up by God to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yet they do not leave off thoſe Impurities, even among thoſe very <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. But perhaps their Enemies, among whom they are, are ſuch ſort of Men, that they are pleas'd with ſuch kind of Doings, and would be mightily offended, if they ſhould ſee the <hi>Romans</hi> chaſte, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are unchaſte? Which if it were ſo, yet other Men's Wickedneſs ſhould not make us wicked, becauſe it concerns every Man much more to take care that he be good, than it can any other Man, that he be bad; and to take more Pains to pleaſe God by Honeſty, than to humour Men by Impurity. And ſo admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that any one did live among unchaſte <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> he ought rather to follow Chaſtity, which makes for himſelf, than unchaſtity to pleaſe his impure Enemies. But what addition is there further to our Wickedneſſes? Why, we are unchaſte among chaſte <hi>Barbarians:</hi> Nay further, the very <hi>Barbarians</hi> are offended with our Ledwneſſes. There is no Whore-Maſter <hi>Goth</hi> permitted among the <hi>Goths;</hi> 'tis the <hi>Romans</hi> only, to the prejudice of their Name and Nation, who among them are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be lewd. What hope is there then for us, I would fain know before God? We love Unchaſtity, the <hi>Goths</hi> abominate it; we ſhun Purity, they court it; Fornication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them is Criminal and Dangerous; with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100854:117"/>
us 'tis Creditable. And do we think we are able to ſtand before God; do we think we can be ſafe, when every Sin of Impurity, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Filthineſs of Unchaſtity is admitted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and puniſh'd by the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> I deſire to know in this place of thoſe, who take us to be better than the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> let them name me the ſmalleſt Number of <hi>Goths,</hi> who do any thing of this; or let them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any of theſe Crimes, that All the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or almoſt All of them do not practice? And do we wonder then, if the Lands either of the <hi>Aquitanes,</hi> or of all of Us, be given by God to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when thoſe places which the <hi>Romans</hi> had defil'd by their Uncleanneſs, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> now purifie by their Chaſtity?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But it may be, this is only among the <hi>Aquitanes?</hi> Let us paſs then to other Parts of the World, leſt we ſhould ſeem to have ſpoke only of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> And have not the ſame, or, it may be, greater Vices, deſtroy'd the Provinces of <hi>Spain?</hi> Which, altho' the Divine Vengeance has indeed, deliver'd to ſome other <hi>Barbarians;</hi> yet the Foes of Purity have ſuffer'd Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments equal to their wicked Deſerts. But there is this over and above, to manifeſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Unchaſtity there, that they ſhould be given into the hands of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> that is, to chaſte <hi>Barbarians.</hi> God by that Captivity of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had a mind to ſhew, by two ſeveral ways, both how much he hated the Luſt of the Fleſh, and how much he lov'd Chaſtity; when he both put the <hi>Vandals</hi> over them, purely on account of their Modeſty,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100854:118"/>
and put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under them, purely on account of their Immodeſty. For what; were not there in all the World to be found more ſtout <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to whom the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> might have been deliver'd? Yes, many doubtleſs; nay, unleſs I am miſtaken, all of them. But he therefore deliver'd up all to the weakeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that he might ſhew that it is not ſo much Strength which prevails, as the Cauſe; nor that we were at that time overthrown by the Valour of our Enemies, but were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by the Uncleanneſs of our Vices only. So that that Saying, which our Lord uſes to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is fully come upon us; <hi>According to</hi>

But yet, ſince almoſt all the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations have drunk the <hi>Roman</hi> Blood, and all have torn our Bowels; how comes it, that our God hath given the greateſt Riches of the Commonwealth, and the wealthieſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all that bore the Name of <hi>Romans,</hi> into the Power chiefly of thoſe, we formerly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the moſt Cowardly of our Enemies?

So likewiſe <hi>Gideon</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with a few, to fight againſt the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,</hi>

leſt by their Number, they might claim to themſelves a Share in the Victory. So that, when he had gather'd together thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Armed Men, the Lord ſpoke thus unto<note place="margin">

And he order'd his Army to be reduc'd to that ſlender Number, that the fewneſs of them might not be able to uſurp to themſelves any thing of the Victory, beſtow'd on them from above. But why the Lord was pleas'd to do thus, he declares moſt plainly, when he ſays: <hi>Leſt Iſracl vaunt themſelves againſt</hi>

               <p n="9">IX. Let all, I ſay, hear this who blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly boaſt the contrary, let thoſe who put their truſt in Man hear this. God ſays, that all they who preſume they can be deliver'd by their own Strength do ſpeak againſt him. But where is there one of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who does not ſpeak ſo; who does not think ſo? Who is he of our ſide, who does not almoſt always Blaſpheme in this particular? That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth has now no Strength left, is what every Man knows, and neither by that do we acknowledge to whoſe loving-kindneſs we owe,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100854:119"/>
that we are even yet alive. For if at any time beyond our hopes and deſert, God does beſtow upon us ſome little Proſperity, one aſcribes it preſently to Fortune, another to Chance, one to the good Conduct of the Officers, another to prudent Council, ſome to their Maſter, others to their Patron, but no body to God. And yet we wonder if Heaven does not do ſomething for us, when we diminiſh every thing we receive from it. For what elſe do we, when we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the good things we receive thence either to caſual Events, or to the Valour of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or to any other frivolous Matters? For by as good reaſon we ought to give Thanks to the Earth, becauſe we gather our yearly Fruits, and to the Vineyard for our Vintage, and to the Sea that we catch Fiſh, to the Woods that we cut Timber from them, to the Sheep for our Cloaths, and to the other Cattle that we are cramm'd with Fleſh. For what reaſon is there that we are thankful to Him for other Favours, when we Rob Him of the Thanks due for His greateſt Benefits? What Man is there of our own Condition, who is content that any one ſhould own the having receiv'd ſome ſmall Kindneſs from him, and yet ſhould ſtifle or Diminiſh ſome greater Obligation? So we, altho' we do not give God Thanks in any particular as we ought, yet it is very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, if we are only thankful barely for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life. Why do we forbear to Thank Him for His help in our Diſtreſſes, that he gives us Deliverance in times of Danger, and for His Preſervation and Protection in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100854:120"/>
midſt of ſo many Barbarous Nations? The <hi>Goths</hi> do not do thus, this is not the way of the <hi>Vandals;</hi> altho' their Inſtructors be but indifferent, yet in this particular they are much better than we. I have reaſon to think ſome will be offended at what I ſay. But ſince Truth is more to be regarded than any Mans Diſpleaſure, I will ſay it and ſay it again: The <hi>Goths</hi> do not do thus, this is not the Practice of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who when they are in any Danger beg help of God, and call their Succeſſes the Gift of Heaven. Our Misfortune in a late Encounter is a Proof of this. For when the <hi>Goths</hi> were afraid, we preſum'd to put our Confidence in the <hi>Huns;</hi> but they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, when they ſued to us for Peace, we deny'd them; they ſent our Biſhops, we rejected them; they Honoured God in His Prieſts tho' of <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Goths</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Valens.</hi>

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believed that he could Captivate the Enemy without the Aſſiſtance and help of Heaven, he himſelf was made a Priſoner. He pretended to the higheſt pitch of Counſel and Wiſdom, and yet incurr'd the Diſgrace of Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardineſs. The Shackles he prepar'd for others, he carried himſelf. and pray how could the Judgment of God appear more evidently, than that he, who had the daringneſs of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, ſhould himſelf become a Booty, who preſuming upon Triumph, ſhould himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Subject of one; ſhould be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd about, hall'd along; ſhould be bound, have his Arms ty'd behind him; ſhould ſee thoſe Hands Shackl'd, which he thought were excellent at Fighting; ſhould become a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to Children and Women; ſhould ſee the <hi>Barbarians</hi> playing Tricks with him; ſhould bear the Taunts and Scoffs of both Sexes; and that he, who had all the Arrogance and Pride of a Man of Mettle, ſhould undergo the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100854:121"/>
Death of a Coward. And I wiſh this were the ſhort Remedy of his Misfortunes, and that his Torments were not more laſting. For he, as to the Puniſhment they inflicted on him, being kept a long time in Goal by the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and waſting under a lingring Diſtemper, was reduc'd to that Miſery, That, which Men oftentimes take to be more grievous and bitter than their Hardſhips, he was even pitied by his very Enemies. And how came all this to paſs?

Here now, I would know, whether any one of our ſide ever did thus, or who would not be ridicul'd, that ſhould but think of doing it? He would be ſcoffed at with a Witneſs; as almoſt every thing that relates to Religion is by our People. And therefore, what Advantage can it be to us to have a Religious Title, that we call our ſelves Catholicks, and boaſt of the Purity of our Faith; that we deſpiſe the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> and upbraid them with the Name of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, when we our ſelves live as wickedly as any Hereticks can do?

So that all that happens to them is to be aſcrib'd to their own Tranſgreſſions, and not to God; for the action is juſtly aſcrib'd to that thing that requir'd, that the Action ſhould be done.

So that the <hi>Vandals</hi> paſſing over into <hi>Africa,</hi> is not to be aſcrib'd to the Severity of Heaven, but to the viciouſneſs of the <hi>Africans.</hi> For they drew them there by their grievious and long impieties a great while before they came at them, and therefore we ſhould obſerve that it was Gods loving-kindneſs, that he deferr'd the Puniſhment which had been ſo long due; and their own Sin and Wickedneſs, that a ſinful People did ſometime receive what they had deſerv'd. Unleſs, it may be, we think the People of <hi>Africa</hi> did not deſerve this, when none deſerv'd more, as having among them a Collection of all ſorts and ſizes of Wickedneſſes and Uncleanneſſes. For other People, altho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were in Bondage to ſome ſorts of Vice
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100854:124"/>
and Naughtineſs, yet were not entangled in all; altho' they may be given to tipling, yet they are free from Spite and Malice; tho' they burn with Luſt, yet they do not tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in rapine; and laſtly, tho' the incontinence of their bodies accuſes ſome, yet the ſimplicity of their manners, in other reſpects, at the ſame time commends them: But among almoſt all the <hi>Africans,</hi> there is nothing of theſe which belongs to both, that is, to the Good as well as the Bad, becauſe the whole is thro'ly Evil. So that the Integrity of their former Natures being excluded, their Vices ſeem in ſome ſort to have made them another kind of Natures.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. For excepting a very few Servants of God, what was the whole Territory of <hi>Africa,</hi> but one Family full of Vices? Like that Pot of which the Prophet ſpeaks? <hi>Wo to the bloody</hi>

is meant a diverſity of Men. And ſo even Silver, that is, a Metal of a Nobler make is put into the ſame fire, becauſe the beſt Parts and nobleſt Nature by a degenerate life are condemn'd. Thus alſo we read that the Lord ſpoke by the Prophet concerning the Prince of <hi>Tyre.

have more truth in it than this? For from the midſt of their Iniquities, the fire of Sin is gone forth, which has conſum'd all the Happineſs of the former times. <hi>And all,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who knew thee among the Nations ſhall</hi>

               <p n="5">XV. But God out of His loving-kindneſs and Mercy cannot ſuffer that to be. Tho' as far as appertains to the Merit of our Crimes, the Matter is ſuch, that he may ſeem to ſuffer it. For what Villanies are there, which have not been always committed there? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak of all, becauſe they are both uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and irregular, and are ſo great that they cannot be either known or ſpoke of. I only now mention the beaſtlineſs of their Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and which is worſe, of their Sacrileges. I paſs by in any of them the greedy deſire of having, as a Vice common to all Mankind. I ſhall ſay nothing of the inhumanity of their avarice, which is an Evil peculiar to almoſt all the <hi>Romans.</hi> I ſhall leave their Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs undiſturb'd, as being common to both Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Simple, their Pride and loftineſs ſhall be buried in Silence. This is ſo reigning a Sin among the great Men, that perhaps they may
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100854:125"/>
think they loſe ſomewhat of their Right, if any one ſhould claim any parcel of it. And in the laſt place, I ſhall not touch upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of their Frauds, Falſities and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. No <hi>Roman</hi> City was ever without their Evils. Altho' the Wickedneſſes ſeem more eſpecially to belong to all the <hi>Africans.</hi> For as all Dirt and Filth runs into the Sink, or Hold of an high built Ship, ſo, as from all Parts of the World, have Vices flown into their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For I know of no kind of Wickedneſs whatever, which did not more than abound there; when yet, even the <hi>Pagan</hi> and uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd People, altho' they have Vices peculiarly their own, yet all things among them, are not worthy of deteſtation. The <hi>Goths</hi> are Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, but yet they are chaſte. The <hi>Alans</hi> are unchaſte, but then they are not ſo perfidious; The <hi>Franks</hi> are Lyars, but are Hoſpitable; The <hi>Saxons</hi> are Cruel and Barbarous, but are remarkable for their Continence. So all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they have ſome peculiar Vices, ſo they have ſome Virtues. But among almoſt all the <hi>Africans,</hi> I do not know any thing that is not Evil. If inhumanity is blameworthy, they are inhumane; if Drunkenneſs, they are Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; if Falſeneſs, they are moſt Falſe; if De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they are moſt deceitful; if Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are moſt rapacious; if Perfidy, they are moſt perfidious. But their Uncleanneſs, and their Blaſphemy are not to be joyn'd to all theſe: For in thoſe Evils beforementioned, they have ſurpaſſed the Vices of other Nations, but in theſe they have out-done even their own.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100854:126"/>XVI. And in the firſt place, to begin with their Uncleanneſs, who knows not that whole <hi>Africa</hi> has always burnt with the obſcene Fire of Luſts; that you would not take it for a Land or Habitation of Men, but rather an <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of unchaſte Flames? For as <hi>Aetna</hi> rages with the inteſtine Heats of fermenting Nature, ſo <hi>Africa</hi> always boils with the abominable Fire of Fornications. I do not deſire to be believ'd, meerly for my aſſerting it. Take evidence from all Mankind. Who does not know that all the People of <hi>Africa</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incontinent, unleſs, it may be, they are converted to God; that is, are changed by Faith and Religion? But that is as great a Novelty and Rarity, as it would be to ſee one,<note place="margin">That John a Stiles ſhould not be John a Stiles, and John of Nokes ſhould not be John of Nokes.</note> whoſe name was <hi>Gaius</hi> not to be <hi>Gaius;</hi> and one whoſe name was <hi>Sejus,</hi> not to be <hi>Sejus.</hi> For it is as uncommon and unuſual, not to have an <hi>African</hi> unchaſte, as that an <hi>African</hi> ſhould not be an <hi>African:</hi> For the Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence is ſo general among them, that whoever of them do ever leave off to be lewd, does not ſeem to be an <hi>African.</hi> I ſhall not run through all places, nor examine every City, leſt I may ſeem ſtudiouſly, to enquire after, and narrowly to ſearch for what I ſay. I ſhall<note place="margin">Of the Splendour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                  </note> be content with one only, and that the Head and <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all the Cities there: She that was always Rival to our <hi>Rome,</hi> formerly in Arms and Might, and afterward in Beauty and Power: <hi>Carthage,</hi> I mean, both the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Adverſary of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Africa:</hi> which alone is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100854:126"/>
for me, as an Evidence and Example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had within it all things, by which the Diſcipline of any Commonwealth in the whole world is either govern'd or manag'd. There are all the Neceſſaries of publick Offices; there are Schools of the liberal Arts, and Lectures of Philoſophy, and all Inſtructions to be had in Languages or Manners. There is a ſtanding Army, and Officers to lead them. There was the Dignity of a Proconſul, a conſtant Judge and Governour, call'd indeed a Proconſul; but a Conſul in his Power. And laſtly, there were all ſort of Officers there, and places different in Degree and Name, and, as I may ſay, a ſort of Procurators of every Street and Alley, for the Governing all places of the City and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the People. I am therefore ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with only this One, as an Example and Evidence of the reſt; that we may underſtand in what State thoſe Cities were, which had leſs Care taken of, and Government among them; when we ſhall ſee in what a Condition this was, where the Chiefeſt Magiſtrates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſided. But in this place, I almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me of my Promiſe, that is, that I engag'd above to paſs by all the other Crimes of <hi>Africa,</hi> and to ſpeak only of their Blaſphemies and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes. For methinks, I ſee the City over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with Vices, and the place reeking in all kind of Iniquities, crowded with People; but more with all Uncleanneſs, full of Riches; but fuller far of Vices; Men ſtriving with each other for the Maſtery in the Naughtineſs of their Villanies; ſome offering at the Prize in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100854:127"/>
Rapine, and others by their Lewdneſs. Some reeling with their Wine, and others gorg'd with Gluttony; ſome with their Garlands on their Heads, and others dawb'd with Unguents, and all loſt in divers ſorts of Luxury and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, but yet deſtroy'd almoſt All by one Death of Errors; they are not all indeed fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with tippling Wine, but yet are all quite drunken in their Sins. You would take the People to be much diſorder'd, to be out of their Senſes, to be neither ſound in their Mind, nor in their going; but, like <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s mad Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, haſtning in Crowds to Riot and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. But now of what ſort is that, and how grievous; different indeed in Kind, but not different in Iniquity, unleſs perhaps, it be eſteem'd different in this, becauſe 'tis greater. I mean the Pillaging of Orphans, the Afflicting of Widows, and the Torments of the Poor, who daily lamenting unto God, and begging an End of their Misfortunes; and, which is worſt of all, thro' the bitterneſs of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, ſometimes craving of God to bring an Enemy, have at length obtain'd from Him, that they ſhould undergo the common Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which they alone before only bore from the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Well, it ſhall be ſo, all theſe things ſhall be paſs'd over, for they are acted almoſt all over the <hi>Roman</hi> World; beſide, I promis'd, that in this place, I would ſpeak ſomewhat of theſe Wickedneſſes. What then ſhall I ſay of that Unchaſtity and Uncleanneſs which I now ſpeak of; was not it alone ſufficient to deſtroy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100854:127"/>
the <hi>Africans?</hi> For what part of the City was there, that was not full of Filthineſs, what Street or Lane within the Place, that was not a Bawdy-houſe? They dugg always, either as Traps of Luſt, or ſpread them forth as Nets; ſo that, even they, who had no manner of Inclination to them, yet could ſcarce avoid them. You might in a manner ſee the Sets of Highway-Men waiting for the Plunder of paſſing Travellers, who, by the cloſeneſs of their frequent Snares, ſo hemm in all Paths, all narrow Lanes and Turnings, that ſcarce any one with all his Caution, but would fall into ſome of the Traps, altho' he had freed himſelf from many of them before. All the Citizens of that place, as I may ſay, ſtunk with the dirt of Luſt, mutually breathing on each other the naſty Savour of Vncleanneſs. But theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid things did cauſe no dread in them, becauſe they All were equally concern'd. You'd think there were one Commonſhore of Luſt and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, a publick Jaques made up from all the Streets and Privies. And what hope could be there, where, except in the Church of God, there was nothing but dirtineſs to be ſeen. But why do I ſpeak of the Church of God? For that belongs ſolely to the Biſhops and Clergy, whom I do not enquire after, becauſe I reſerve all imaginable Reſpect to the Miniſters of my Lord; for they, I believe, only remain'd undefiled at the Altar; as we read, that <hi>Lot</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.</note> at the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> was remaining alone in the Mountain. But as far as concerns the People, who was there in that almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100854:128"/>
Number of them that was chaſte? Chaſte do I ſay? Who was not a Fornicator, who was not an Adulterer, and that without ceaſing, without ending? And therefore I am forced to cry again, What hope is there of ſuch a People, where, when ſometimes one Adulterer has defiled the whole Congregation of Chriſtians; there, if you ſeek as diligently as you can among ſo many Thouſands, you will ſcarce find one chaſt Perſon in the Church? Nay, I have woſe to add. And I wiſh there were only what I have ſaid, and that the Lewdneſs of the Men had been content to have been defiled with the uſe of their dirty Whores only. That is grievous and more heinous, that thoſe things of which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains with the greateſt Sorrow and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation have been almoſt all among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans; viz. That the men leaving the natural</hi>

Not at all, but of us, that is, of us <hi>Romans</hi> in particular: whom, when the <hi>Africans</hi> could not formerly overcome in Power and Empire, they have done the only thing they could; they have overcome them in Uncleanneſs. Whoever therefore thinks he has reaſon to be angry with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100854:128"/>
me, let him be rather angry with the Apoſtle, becauſe that what I ſay, the People of <hi>Africa</hi> were, the ſame the Apoſtle ſays of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were their Maſters.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. But, it may be, what I ſpeak of was either done in ſecret, or at leaſt the Magiſtrates took care, that ſuch Wickedneſs ſhould not be publiſh'd to ſcandalize the Government, and defile the eyes of the City. Which, if it had been done, altho' many had been guilty of the Fact, yet all would not be polluted in Sight and Mind; for an Action wicked enough, if it be done privily, does not uſe to deſerve the Credit of a villanous Act. But it is above all the execrable and monſtrous Offences to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the higheſt Tranſgreſſion, and yet not to be aſhamed of the Sin. I deſire to know what can be more prodigious than this? In a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian City, in an Eccleſiaſtical City, which the Apoſtles had formerly inſtructed in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which Martyrs have crown'd with their Paſſions; the Men in the uſe of their Bodies have own'd themſelves Women, and that without any the leaſt ſhadow of Shame, or any covering to their Modeſty: and in ſuch manner, as if it were a ſmall Matter, that the Authors only of the Sin ſhould be defil'd with the Wickedneſs, by the publick profeſſion of the Crime, it became the Guilt of the whole City. For all the City ſaw it, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it: The Judges ſaw it, and wink'd at it, the people ſaw it, and applauded it; and ſo by the joint publiſhing of the Scandal and<note place="margin">or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> the Crime thro' the whole City, altho' they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100854:129"/>
were not guilty of the Fact, yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it, made it the Crime of all. But it may be, there was ſome time or other, an end put to the Corruption, and the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? Who can believe or hear, that the Men chang'd not only their Uſe and Nature into Female paſſiveneſs, but even their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Gate, Dreſs, and every thing that was Manly, either in the Uſe or Dreſs. All things were ſo perverted and diſtorted, that ſince nothing ought to put a Man more out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, than to have any thing about him that looks effeminate; there, nothing ſeem'd more diſgraceful to ſome Men, than when they ſeem'd to have any thing manly about them.</p>

For altho' they are but few who are Actors in ſuch ſcandalous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, there are many, who are defil'd with the filthineſs of thoſe Few. For as one Harlot makes many Whore-maſters, ſo the accurſed Mixtures of a few effeminate Ones pollutes a great Part of the People.

very heart of the Commonwealth? For that Great and Mighty Power which can hinder the greateſt Naughtineſs, does, as it were, licenſe that Thing to be done, if knowingly it ſuffers it to be còmmitted. For in whoſoever's Power it is to forbid a Sin, if he does not forbid the Commiſſion of it, he commands it to be done.</p>

Let us ſee if any thing like this be committed by the <hi>Vandals.</hi> And really a ſtrange People, puffed up and ſwoln with Victory and Succeſs, diſſolv'd in the Abundance of Riches and Delights; altho' they had been always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt chaſte and continent, might yet have been chang'd, by ſuch a torrent of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, having entred a Land, that in the Scripture Phraſe, flow'd with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">

Who would not think now, but that the <hi>Vandals</hi> entring theſe places, plung'd themſelves in the Filth of all manner of Vices and Uncleanneſſes; or to ſpeak the leaſt, that they did the ſame things the <hi>Africans</hi> had always done, into
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100854:130"/>
whoſe places they ſucceeded? And really, if they had done only the ſame things, they might be reputed chaſte and modeſt, ſince Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs did not make them more vicious. For how many are there, even of wiſe Men, whom Proſperity does not alter, and whom Vices does not encreaſe with their Eſtates? And hence it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Vandals</hi> would have been moſt temperate, if they as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had been ſuch, as thoſe whom they cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and ſubdued. But what, was no one of them unmann'd among all this Luxury? Does no ſuch thing appear? 'Tis certain, that it was very common with the Noble <hi>Romans</hi> to be ſo. But what ſhall I ſay more? Were none of them polluted with the Inceſt of the Effeminate <hi>Romans</hi> there? 'Tis certain, that this was long ago ſo eſteem'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it was rather thought to be a Vertue than a Vice; and they were look'd upon to be the ſtouteſt Men, who were moſt robuſt Stallions. Whence it came, that for a Reward to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Scoundrels, who follow'd the Army of Striplings, it was decreed as to a meritorious Service, That ſince they were luſty Fellows, they ſhould have the Pleaſure of uſing Men as Women. O horrid! And this by <hi>Romans;</hi> and further, <hi>Romans</hi> not of this Age: But yet, leſt we accuſe the old Ones, <hi>Romans;</hi> but not the antient ones: But after they became diſſolute and debauch'd, and utterly unlike themſelves and their Anceſtors, and more like <hi>Greeks</hi> than <hi>Romans.</hi> So that (as I have often ſaid before) it no wonder that the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100854:131"/>
ſhould ſometime ſuffer what they have long ſince deſerv'd.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. This Uncleanneſs then began among the <hi>Romans</hi> before the Goſpel appear'd, and what is worſe, has continued after the Goſpel. Now who after this can forbear to admire the <hi>Vandals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who entring this moſt wealthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where all theſe wickedneſſes were every where committed, ſo poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Delights of the debauch'd Inhabitants, as to deſpiſe their Debauchery and Lewdneſs, to take to themſelves the uſe of what was good, and to avoid the uncleanneſs of the bad. So that this is a ſufficient Commendation of them, tho' I ſhould ſay no more. For they abominated the filthineſs of Men, nay more than they abominated that of Women; they abhorr'd the Stews and Brothels, and abhorr'd the lying or medling with the common Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. And can this ſeem credible to any, that the <hi>Romans</hi> committed theſe things, and that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> abhorr'd them? Or is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any thing more to be ſaid, after what I have ſaid already? Yes there is, and a great deal too. For that I have ſaid they avoided the Filthineſſes themſelves, it is but a ſmall Matter. For any one may deteſt Baſeneſs, but not remove it. But that is truly Great and of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Merit, not only not to be polluted ones ſelf, but alſo to make Proviſion, that no one ſhall ever after be defil'd. For he does in ſome ſort provide for the Welfare of Mankind, who do's not only take care that he himſelf be good; but endeavours what he can that others may
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100854:131"/>
leave off to be bad. This which I ſay is Great, truly Great, and Extraordinary. Who could believe that <hi>Vandals</hi> did theſe Things in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Cities? All uncleanneſs of the Fleſh is utterly remov'd from among them. But how is it remov'd? Not as Things us'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who make a Law, that no one ſhall commit Adultery, and they are the firſt Adulterers; and Enact that no one ſteal, when themſelves are the firſt Thieves.<note place="margin">Of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</note> Altho' I can ſcarce ſay, that they ſteal. For they are not little petty Thieveries they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but Notorious open Robberies. For the Governour puniſhes Cheating in the publick Revenue, when he is the greateſt Robber of the Treaſury; he puniſhes Rapine, when he himſelf is the greateſt Oppreſſor; He puniſhes a Cut-throat, when he is a Gladiator; He puniſhes the <hi>breakers of Doors and Windows,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Burglars.</note> when he overturns whole Towns; He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Robbers and Breakers of Houſes, when he deſtroys and robs whole Provinces and Cities. And I wiſh they only did this, who were in Power and Places, and whoſe Station gives them a kind of Right to uſe theſe Robberies and Oppreſſions. But it is grievous and more intolerable, that thoſe who have been formerly in Places and Honours; but now are private Men, ſhould do this. The Station, it ſeems, they once had, gives them ſo Great a Privilege, that they have always a Right of Robbing. So that when they ceaſe to have the Adminiſtration of their publick Power, they ſtill reſerve private Power to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100854:132"/>
Plunder. So that the Power they had, when Governours, was much more eaſie, than what they have as private Men. For in that, they are often ſucceeded, in this never. Now pray what ſignifie Laws; what Advantage is there from any publick Sanctions, when they who adminiſter them, contemn them moſt? The common and ordinary People are forc'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, the poorer Sort are compell'd to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be Subject to their Orders; and if they do not, are certainly puniſh'd for it. For they have the ſame Reaſon done them in this Matter, as they have in their Taxes. They only obſerve the publick Laws, as only they pay the Taxes. And ſo in the very Laws, and in the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Ordinances, there is the greateſt Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Injuſtice, when the meaner People are forc'd to obſerve that as ſacred and inviolable, which the greater Folk diſregard, and tread upon their feet.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. I have broke off the thread of my Diſcourſe a little, being forc'd to it by the unworthineſs of the Things I was ſpeaking of. But now I return to what I was ſaying before. I have ſaid then, that the Cities of <hi>Africa,</hi> were full of monſtrous Impurities, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſhe that was the Queen and Miſtreſs of them all; but that the <hi>Vandals</hi> were not polluted by any of them. Theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> then, of whom I ſpeak, who were to reform our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Filthineſs, were no ſuch Men. For they utterly took away out of all Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> the Uncleanneſſes of the Effeminate Men; they abhorr'd the Contagions of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100854:132"/>
Common Whores; neither did they abhor or remove them only for a Time, but they made them altogether ceaſe to be. O good Lord, and merciful Saviour, how ſtrange are the Effects of Diſcipline and Government, by which the Vices of Nature may be chang'd, as they were altogether changed by them! But how were they chang'd? For it is of Moment to tell, not only the Effects of Things, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Cauſes of thoſe Effects. For it is to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe to take away Unchaſtity by Word or Order, unleſs you remove it indeed: And 'twill ſignifie very little to require Chaſtity by Words, unleſs you exact it heartily: which they being very ſenſible of, did ſo take away the Unchaſtity, that they preſerv'd the unchaſte Perſons, not putting the miſerable Harlots to death, leſt they ſhould blemiſh the Cure of their Vices with the Blot of Cruelty; and whilſt they deſir'd to take away their Sinning, they themſelves ſhould ſin in the cutting off their Offences. But they ſo amended the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that what they did was a real Medicine, but no Puniſhment. For they commanded and compell'd all the Harlots, to betake themſelves to Marriage, and ſo converted Fornication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wedlock: thereby fulfilling that Saying and Command of the Apoſtle: <hi>That every</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. 7. v.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>man ſhould have his own Wife, and every Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her own Huusband;</hi> ſo that as Incontinence could not otherwiſe be bridled, without the uſe of ſuch carnal Mixtures; ſo the Bodily heat ſhould receive it's lawful uſe, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence might not have in it Sin. By
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100854:133"/>
which management, they did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that thoſe Women ſhould have Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who could not contain without them, but alſo, that they who were not able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves, might be ſafe under the eye of their Domeſtick Guardians; and ſo always ſubmitting to their Husband's Government, altho' the Habit of their former Uncleanneſſes entic'd them to Naughtineſs; yet the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Care of a Husband might keep them from the Sin. Beſide this, to reſtrain Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, they added ſevere Laws to eſtabliſh Chaſtity, and to puniſh Incontinence; that both the Affection of Marriage might keep both Sexes clean at home, as the Dread of the Laws do the ſame abroad: That ſo Chaſtity might be defended by a double Guard, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething at home to be beloved, and ſomewhat abroad to be afraid of. But theſe Laws were not by any means like thoſe, which ſo take away one part of the Wickedneſs, that they allow another part of the Uncleanneſs: Or, as thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Edicts that forbid Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter's going near other Men's Wives, but allow them the uſe of all ſingle Women; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Adulteries, but erecting Brothels. I ſuppoſe they were afraid that Men would be too chaſte and clean, if they kept them from all ſort of Uncleanneſs. But ſo did not they of whom we are ſpeaking, who prohibited For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication as Adultery; who would have Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be no Women, but to their own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and the Men be no Men, but to their own Wives; who ſuffer Luſt to wander no
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100854:133"/>
farther than the lawful Bed, ordering their Laws after the Model of the Divine Laws, believing, that nothing was lawful to be done in that Caſe, but what God had thought lawful. And therefore they did not think, that any thing was to be allow'd to any man by them, unleſs what was permitted to all by God Himſelf.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. I am ſenſible that what I have ſaid, will ſeem intolerable to ſome Men. But we are to be guided by the Reaſon of Things, and not by any one's Fancy or Pleaſure. Let that Man, whoever he be, that is diſpleas'd with what I ſay, tell me, whether <hi>Socrates</hi> was not always eſteem'd the wiſeſt of Men, and that too by the Teſtimony of the Daemon of <hi>Delphos,</hi> who, as he was the Chief of the Philoſophers, ſo he was of the Devils. Let us ſee then, what Laws <hi>Socrates</hi> enacted relating to Chaſtity, and what they did of whom I am ſpeaking. <hi>Let no man,</hi> ſays <hi>Socrates, have a Wife to himſelf, for Marriages ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all. For by this Means Cities will agree much better together, if all Men lie with all Women without any difference; then all Women will allow the uſe of their Bodies to all Men without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; and ſo all Men will become the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of all Women, and all Women the Wives of all Men.</hi> Did we ever know any body in a Frenzy, or Poſſeſs'd, or ſtark Staring mad, that ever utter'd any thing like this? You grand Philoſopher then ſay, that by this means all Men will be the Husbands of all Women, and all Women the Wives of all Men, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100854:134"/>
Ones thus begot, the Children of all. But I on the contrary ſay, that by this Means, there is not any Man, who is the Husband of any Woman; neither is any Woman the Wife of any Man, nor any of the Of-ſpring the Child of any Parent. For where all things lie in common and confus'd, there no body has a Property in any thing. Neither was it enough for this Great Sage, as they call him, to teach this Doctrine, unleſs he alſo practis'd it; for he gave away his own Wife to another Man; as did alſo the <hi>Roman Cato,</hi> that is, another <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi> Loe here, what are the extraordinary Patterns ſet us by the Wiſdom of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> They make all Husbands, as much as in them lies, to be Pimps and Panders to their own Wives. But <hi>Socrates</hi> was Victor in this, for he wrote Books upon the Subject, and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſhameful Things for Poſterity. But however, his Precepts were to be bragg'd of: For his Doctrine makes only one publick Stews of the whole World. He is ſaid to be unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn'd by his Judges. And true it is: For all Mankind with more Juſtice ſhould have condemn'd him, when he was ſetting forth ſuch Principles as theſe, as undoubtedly they did condemn him. For ſince in this particular all have rejected his Doctrine; they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him, not only by the Authority of a Sentence, but which is much more, by their contrary Practice; and juſtly. For let his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be compar'd wit the Orders of thoſe, whom God has made Maſters of <hi>Africa.</hi> He ordain'd, that no body ſhould have a Wife to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100854:134"/>
himſelf; they, that no body ſhould have any but his own; He would have every VVoman Proſtitute her ſelf to all Men; they, that no woman ſhould know any other but her own Husband; He was for a mixt and confus'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they, for a chaſte and regular one; he would have every Houſe a Brothel, they, no ſuch thing; he endeavour'd to erect Stews in all Habitations, they, took them all down out of the Cities; he was for proſtituting all Virgins, and they made the lewd women chaſte. I could wiſh heartily that this had been only <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Error; and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many, nay almoſt All the <hi>Romans,</hi> were not infected with it, who, altho' they do not by any means imitate <hi>Socrates</hi> in other Particulars of his Life, yet in this they follow him cloſely: For both many Men have each many Wives, and a great many Women have each many Husbands. And are not all the Cities full of Stews, and even ſtink with Brothel-houſes? And why do I ſay all? 'Tis certain the greateſt and and richeſt are ſuch. For 'tis a ſort of Privilege and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the great Cities, that as much as they excel others in greatneſs, they ſhould out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do them in Uncleanneſs. I would fain know then, what hope the States of <hi>Rome</hi> can have, when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> are more chaſte and clean than the <hi>Romans?</hi> But I mince the Matter; What hope I pray, of either Life or Pardon before God, can there be for us, when we ſee ſuch Chaſtity in the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and yet we ceaſe to be chaſte? Let us bluſh for ſhame, and be confounded, There are no unchaſte
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100854:135"/>
Perſons now among the <hi>Goths,</hi> but the <hi>Romans,</hi> and among the <hi>Vandals,</hi> even the <hi>Romans</hi> are not ſuch. The deſire of Chaſtity, and the ſeverity of Diſcipline, have done ſuch Mighty things among them, as not only to make themſelves chaſte, but to do a new thing, a Thing incredible, and never heard of before, they have made even the <hi>Romans</hi> chaſte. If I had ſtrength, I would make ſuch an Out-cry, as the whole World ſhould hear me: Be aſham'd at length, you <hi>Romans,</hi> be aſham'd of your way of living. You have no Cities without Stews, none altogether free from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, but thoſe only, in which the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> have begun to be. And do we wonder then, if we are miſerable, who are ſo very lewd? do we wonder that we are conquer'd by the Enemy, who ſurpaſs us in Honeſty? Do we wonder that they poſſeſs our Goods, who abominate our wickedneſſes? It is not any natural Strength in their Bodies that makes them overcome us, neither is it any natural weakneſs in us, that cauſes us to be vanquiſh'd. Let no man perſwade himſelf otherwiſe; let no man think otherwiſe, 'tis our vicious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals alone that have enſlaved us.</p>

For every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would willingly be commended, but no body cares for Reproof: Nay, which is much worſe, be the Perſon never ſo wicked, never ſo deſperate and lewd; yet he had rather be untruly commended, than juſtly rebuk'd; be deceiv'd with the Deluſions of falſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, than be preſerv'd by wholeſome Admonition. And what is to be done in ſuch a Caſe as this? Muſt we gratify this Humour of ungodly Men? Or if they deſire to be courted with ſuch vain Praiſes; Is it fit for us to ſooth them with ſuch Vanity and Deluſion? Eſpecially ſince they, who would be thus
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100854:136"/>
cheated, ought not to be ſo uſed by good Men, as neither ought they to be untruly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who deſire to be ſet off with the falſe Colours of undue Praiſe: For we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not ſo much what every one of theſe Men deſire to hear, as what is moſt fitting for us to ſpeak; eſpecially ſince the Prophet hath ſaid, <hi>Woe be to them that call ſweet bitter, and</hi>

                  <hi>bitter ſweet.</hi> So that by all means, the Truth is to be ſtuck to, and what is in the thing it ſelf, the ſame ſhould be in the Diſcourſe upon it: Thoſe things that have ſweetneſs in them, ſhould be call'd ſweet, and thoſe which have bitterneſs in them, bitter; eſpecially now in ſo ſacred a Concern, where our Iniquities are by many aſcrib'd to God; and ſo that they may ſeem guiltleſs, they preſume to throw the Blame upon God Himſelf. For when they ſay, that he is negligent and regardleſs, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him, as not adminiſtring humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs righteouſly, or not adminiſtring them at all; what do they do leſs than accuſe Him of Lazineſs, miſpending His Time, and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice? O the Folly and Blindneſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, O their Frenzy and Fool-hardineſs! You then, O man, call God negligent and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: If you offer'd ſuch a Compliment to any thing of a Gentleman, you would be guilty of Inſolence and ill Manners: And if to a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a Man of Quality, you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Penalty of the Law for it. Theſe are Reproaches which are thrown on the moſt prodigal Spend-thriſts, and 'tis a Taunt only proper to lewd young Rakehells, who are ſaid
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100854:136"/>
to be Miſpenders, negligent, and regardleſs of their Eſtates. O prophane and ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impudence! We ſay that God Almighty is that, which we do not uſe, even to Men, unleſs the moſt deſperate and wicked. And yet theſe are not the only things are ſaid: For he is accuſed, as I ſaid before, of Injuſtice. For if we do not deſerve the things we ſuffer, and ought not to bear our preſent Miſeries, we make God unjuſt, who commands us to bear evils we have not deſerved. But, ſay you, he does not ſo much order them, as permit them. Granting that it is ſo: How far, I pray you, is he that permits it from him that orders it? For he who knows that we bear ſuch things, and can prevent our bearing them, does without doubt, approve of our bearing what he ſuffers us to endure, Whence we may perceive, that the permiſſion of His Judgment is juſt, and that it is by a Sentence from above that we ſuffer; for ſince all things are under His Juriſdiction, and His will governs all things, whatever Misfortunes or Puniſhments we eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day ſuffer, it is a Cenſure from God's own hand; which Cenſure we bring upon our ſelves by our Sins, and by our Provocations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it. We light the fire of God's wrath, and ſtir up thoſe flames which may conſume us. So that as oft as we bear theſe Evils, that of the Prophet may be juſtly apply'd to us: <hi>Walk in the flame of the fire which ye have</hi>

They had within their Country and Cities, an Inteſtine and deadly Abomination, I mean that She Daemon of the <hi>Africans,</hi> which they call'd (*) <hi>Coeleſtis</hi> (or Heavenly) on which the antient Heathens, I ſuppoſe, beſtow'd that goodly Name, that ſince it had nothing of Divinity in it, it ſhould at leaſt be related to it in the Name; and having no perfection from
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100854:137"/>
its own Power, it ſhould derive ſome Honour from the Appellation. Who was there that was not initiated in the Rites of that Idol? who was not from his very Conception and Birth, devoted to her Service? I do not ſpeak of thoſe, who, as they were Pagans in their Lives, ſo they were in Title and Profeſſion; who, as they were prophane in their Error, ſo they were in their Names. For Paganiſm is more tolerable and leſs wicked in thoſe, whoſe Profeſſion it is: But that is more pernicious and wicked, that many of thoſe, who had publickly profeſs'd Chriſt, yet in their Mind ſerv'd the Idols. For who was there of thoſe who were call'd Chriſtians, who did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that She-Idol, either after Chriſt, or which is much worſe, before Chriſt? Who enters the Houſe of God, that is not full of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of the Sacrifices offer'd to theſe Devils; and with the ſtanch of the Devils themſelves, aſcends God's Altars: ſo that it had not been near ſo great a Crime not to come to the Houſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God at all, as to come thus. For the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who does not come to Church, is only guilty of Negligence; but he who comes in that manner, of Sacrilege. And 'tis a much leſs Offence not to give God the Honour due to Him, than thus to injure and affront Him. And ſo, for that Reaſon, they who have done theſe things, have not given any Honour to God, but rather have taken it from him. For they have, in ſome ſort, perform'd the Service of the Church to the Idol already: For the performance of the Duty at the ſecond place,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100854:138"/>
redounds to his Honour to whom the firſt and chief Devotions are offer'd. See here, what was the Faith, what was the Religion, what was the Chriſtianity of the <hi>Africans,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Great ones! They were call'd Chriſtians, to the diſhonour of Chriſt. When the Apoſtle cries aloud: <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the cup of Devils: Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. 10. v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>be partakers of the Lord's Table and of the Table of Devil's:</hi> It was not enough for them, that with the Cup of the Lord they might drink the Cup of Devils, unleſs they preferr'd it to the other: Neither was it ſufficient for them to compare the Table of Devils to the Table of our Lord, unleſs after the performance of their infamous Superſtitions, coming to the Church of God, by the Inſtigation of the Devil himſelf, they breath'd out their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Incenſe upon the moſt holy Altars of our Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But, ſay you, all did not do theſe things,<note place="margin">How it is a kind of Sacrilege to hate the worſhipers of God.</note> but only the Great and Powerful ones. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be ſo: Yet ſeeing, that the richeſt and greateſt Families fail not to draw the Mobb af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; you ſee that the whole City is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd by the Sacrilegious Superſtitions of a few Great ones. I ſuppoſe no body doubts, but that all their Families were like the Maſters of them, if not worſe, for ſo they are generally. And ſeeing, that even vertuous Maſters have often very bad Servants, we may eaſily gueſs, what all thoſe Families were, ſince the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Maſters make thoſe ſervile Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures worſe, who were already bad enough
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100854:138"/>
of themſelves. Well, I allow that what I have ſpoke of, belong'd only to ſome Great and powerful ones. But what? were thoſe things any whit leſs that were common to All, both high and low? Such as Hatred and deteſtation of all holy Men: For it is a kind of Sacriledge to hate the Worſhippers of God. For, as if any one beats our Servants, he does, in ſome ſort, beat us by injuring our Servants, and ſo, if a Man's Child is Chaſtis'd by another Perſon, the Father's Affection is a little uneaſie with the Child's Stripes: Even ſo, when any Servant of God is abus'd by any one, God Himſelf is affronted; as our Lord Himſelf ſaid to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth Me,</hi>

The <hi>Africans</hi> then abus'd and hated the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and in them God Himſelf.</p>

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:100854:139"/>IV. But it is ask'd, it may be, how this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of theirs can be prov'd. The ſame way that the <hi>Jews</hi> Hatred of our Saviour, may be prov'd, when they ſaid to Him; <hi>Thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a devil;</hi> when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John 8. v.</hi> 48.</note> Him, blaſphem'd Him, ſpit in His Face, and grated their Teeth at Him. So that our Saviour Himſelf, who endur'd all this, ſays in the <hi>Pſalms; All they that ſee me laugh me to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. 22. v.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Scorn; they ſhoot out the Lip and ſhake the Head.</hi> And in another place: <hi>They tempted and derided me, and gnaſh'd their Teeth upon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem. 20. v.</hi> 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>me.</hi> Juſt thus is the Hatred of the <hi>Africans</hi> toward the Monks, that is, holy Men of God, prov'd; For they derided them, ſlander'd them, rail'd upon them, and abhorr'd them, and did almoſt every thing againſt them, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <hi>Jews</hi> did formerly againſt our Saviour, before they came to the ſhedding of His moſt precious Blood. But, ſay you, they did not put theſe holy Men to Death, as we read the <hi>Jews</hi> did formerly; Whether they ſlew them or no, I know not; I do not ſay they did. But however, this is an admirable Excuſe, that they only wanted that of the heathen Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in them, which is the utmoſt Thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution it ſelf can do. Let us ſuppoſe then, that theſe holy Men were not ſlain there. But what ſhall we make on't, when we ſee that they are not far from Slaying of them, who hate them ſo, as to be willing to ſlay them; eſpecially ſince our Lord ſays: <hi>Whoſoever hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>John 3. v 15. Matt. 5. v.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>his Brother without a Cauſe, is a murderer.</hi> Altho' they did not perſecute theſe Servants of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100854:139"/>
God without a Cauſe. For who can ſay, they perſecuted ſuch Men without a Cauſe, who differ'd from them in all the Particulars of their Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Manners, in whom they ſaw nothing of their own Converſation, becauſe the others were wholly devoted to God. And ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of inclinations is the greateſt cauſe of Diſcords; for it very rarely happens, if ever, that any one can fancy that in another which he diſlikes in himſelf. And therefore they did not hate them, as I ſaid, without a Cauſe, in whom they ſaw every thing oppoſite and contrary to themſelves. For they liv'd alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Wickedneſs, theſe Men in Innocence; they in Luſt, theſe in Chaſtity; they in the Stewes, theſe in the monaſteries; they almoſt always with the Devil, and theſe continually with Chriſt. It was not then without cauſe that that as unhappy as ungodly people could ſcarce ſee within the Cities of <hi>Africa,</hi> and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially within the Walls of <hi>Carthage,</hi> any one cloathed in a long Robe, of pale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and who having parted with his thick and curled Locks was clipp'd even to the Skin, without taunting and deteſtation. For if at any time any Servant of God, either from the monaſteries of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or the holy Places of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or from ſome of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Venerable privacies of the Deſart, came to that City on the buſineſs of his Sacred Office, as ſoon as ever he appear'd to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he receiv'd Reproaches, Slanders, and Abuſes. And not only that, but he was Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the moſt wicked Scoffs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100854:140"/>
Men, and the deriding Hiſſes of the mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Multitude, as with whips and laſhes. So that if any one, who was a ſtranger to the matter, ſhould have ſeen it, he would not ſo much have thought that any Man was abus'd, and made a laughing Stock of, as that ſome ſtrange and unheard of Monſter were expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and driven out of the Place.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Loe, here is the Faith of the People of <hi>Africa,</hi> but eſpecially of thoſe of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The Apoſtles might formerly with much more Safety enter the <hi>Pagan</hi> Cities, the rude and uncivilis'd Crowds of thoſe ungodly Infidels did much leſs abhor their firſt coming and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.

The <hi>Lycaonians</hi> alſo admir'd them ſo much, that when they ſaw the Divine Excellencies, that were in the Apoſtles, they took them to be more than Men.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts 14. v.</hi> 11.</note> But in <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Servants of God could ſcarce appear in either Streets or Lanes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Abuſe and baſe Revilings. This they do not think to be any Perſecution, becauſe they did not likewiſe kill them. High-way Men truly have ſuch a Saying among them, as that they have given ſuch a Man his Life, becauſe they did not take it from him. But in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this was no Favour of the Inhabitants, but of the Laws. For the Laws of the XII Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles forbid that any man loſe his Life, who is not firſt Sentenced to it. By, which we may
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100854:140"/>
perceive in what Extraordinary Eſteem our Lord's Religion was there, where the Servants of God eſcape, becauſe they are ſecur'd by a <hi>Pagan</hi> Law, from being knock'd on the Head by their Fellow-Chriſtians. And yet we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they now ſuffer under the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when theſe holy Men ſuffer'd under <hi>Barbarians</hi> in ſuffering under them. <hi>Righteous therefore</hi>
